  Why is it important to communicate effectively?:

     Communication empowers people and can facilitate a cohesive, effective team. 

     The benefits of collaboration is highly controlled by how well a team communicates effectively.

  Technical Communication:
    communcates technical information in any medium (Technical writing is more objective and research based)

  technical writing:
    - Makes careful use of design and layout to enhance use

    - is ethical, objective, and accurate

    - upholds field/organization foals, cuture and values

    - technical writing I have encountered (programming documentation, cookbook, motherboard manual, lego instructions, khan academy, manuals) 
                                           (this seems quite broad)

January 12th 2023:

  Effective communication is ALWAYS dependant on the rhetorical situation

  Rhetoricial situation:
    Message - purpose(s) of the Message

    Audience - Consumers of said message 

    Author - Who's writing it

    Circulating everything above is the context

    Types of context:

    physical location, 
    what medium is the message, 
    culture,
    your field/discipline
    current events

    Author: 
      Education, profession, personal experience, research documentation, is the writing objective/objective - for credibility

    Message (purpose?): clarity, inform, direct/instruct/teach, persuade

    Audience: (NEEDS - what do they know, what don't they know? - What do they need from this communication)
              (When/where/why will this be used? - to finding the best medium to actually transmit this information)

              (Attitudes - preferences, likes dislikes torwards topic, attitudes torwards the author (you), your organization)

              (Values: core principles/beliefs)

      Audience profile:
        Different levels of audience: primary .... secondary

  Practicing with diffrrent audience types:

January 17th 2023:

  Some common types of technical reports:

    Primary research reports:
      - Lab reports
      - Field reports
      - Progress reports
      - incident or accident reports
      - Compliance reports
      - Structural reports
    Secondary/mixed research reports 
      - Literature reviews
      - Technical background and specification reports
      - Feasibility reports (Cost-benefits)
      - Justification reports
      - Recommendation reports

      Progress reports:
        shows work that needs to be done and work that has been done. Really is just a progress report; they show progress

  short reports:
    1+ pages - not exceeding 5 
    No requirment for font or back matter
    Variable headings (depending on type / rhetorical situation)

  long report:
    in-depth, often analyitical or problem solving in nature
    Multiple audience expected (parts for different audience)
    Expected front and back matter


    common long reports:
      - letter of transmital
      - title page 
      .....

  Making an effective table:
    Generally, introduce visuals before they appear

    Assuming the table is discussed prior to table placement, table label's come first

    The denser the table gets with text the size of the table matters a lot more

  Notes on partial samples:
    could leave a note and say all these below are the same medium 

    they added parrallelism
    _______________________

    Most specific categorizations are used

    Can use numbers instead of writing them in words

    font is too small, the accessibility is affected here

  Avoiding plagarism:
    Plagarism is...
    - Copy / paste 
    - inappropriate 
    - failure to cite or to cite consistently
    - Failure to use quote marks for source

    How to avoid plagarism:
      - Give yourself time to check citations
      - Know the rules 
      - Ask questions
      - Cite not only when quoting, but also summarizing or paraphrasing
        (in engineering, we usually dont avoid quotes because you are the one thats supposed to take of that writing,
        you are the experts - quoting is info from experts. There can be exceptions though)
      - Use proper resources

      Rules of paraphrasing and summarizing:
        - CITED Need to have in intext citations and citations at the footer 
        - SENTENCE STRUCTURE Cant actually have the same sentence strucure as the original source
        - ACCURATE / OBJECTIVE 
        - IN YOUR OWN WORDS

      Paraphrasing steps:
        Read/reread until you understand

        step away from the original text 

        compose what you remember in your own words 

        compare the original with the paraphrase

        Edit any part that break the Paraphrasing rules

      Source attribution:
        - Citing 
        - Source tags in text 

        According to a 2020 pew research center survery.....

      Quotes:
        Keep quotes accurate (verbatim)

        Keep quotes short

January 22 2023:
    A signal that a quotation is coming–generally the author’s name and/or a reference to the work
    An assertion that indicates the relationship of the quotation to your text


January 24th:

  Ethical:
    - Right vs wrong (what we ought to do)

    - Not the same as legal; not objective 

    - moral principles one should apply 

    - respect for people and rights


  Theories:
    Virtue Ethics (Aristotle)- Balance and Compromise

    Rights Ethics (Locke) - Individual worth / benefit 

    Utilitarian Ethics (Mill) - Greatest Benefit to Greatest # 

    Self Realization Ethics (Rand) - Optimal Self is Greatest Benefit 

    How do we determine good, most good, and best interest? 


2023 January 26th:
  We'll be looking at specific examples and language discussions

  Decide a point of view:
    1st person: I, we 

    2nd person: you 

    3rd person: She/he, it, them (most common point of view in technical writing)

      Students, engineers, software developers often...

  Word choice, sentece length, variety:

    aware vs cognizant
    confuse vs obfuscate
    sandy vs Arenaceous
    Total vs aggregate

    - vary sentences and try to limit length to 20 words or less 
    - avoid slang, contractions, negative consutrction, and jargon depending on audience

    Parallelism: using the same structure for listed items

  Cut redudandcies:
    Words/phrases: completetly surrounded on all sides

    Empty modifiers: really, very, kind of, totally 

    Entire sentences or sections

  Tighten....

  Make sure to use an active voice, in comparison to an passive voice 
    passive is less of a direct form of speaking and is harder to read as a result. it also adds more redudandcies

  Use efficient verbs:
    will perform an investigation -> will investigate
    Give instruction -> instuct 
    Take into consideration -> consider 
    Gives a financial advantage -> saves

  INTRODUCTION:

  POSTION OVERVIEW: INCLUDE MOST COMMMON professional organization FOR THIS FIELD, point out documentation style (citation)

  Technical Descriptions:

    - Definitions / Expanded Definitions

    Different contexts:
      Part of a lrger document: proposal, incdent report, websites, etx 

      A paragraph, memo, short report, specification, guides, websites, etc

      Common parts:
        Introduction with prupose and scope of the document 
          intended Audience

        Sentence defiition ofr mechinism

        Function explanation

        Features
          Logical order?

        Conclusion with operation note

        Title and Introduction
          State your object and its Definition....

      Sentence Definition Example:
        A cooling fan is an electromechanical device that uses eletrically-driven propeller to move air
  
      To describe specifications... use diagrams:
        Color, Shape, Texture, methods of attachment, pattter/design, subparts. temperature

    Mechanical Descriptions:
      --How it looks--

    Process Descriptions:
      ---How something works---

      uses indicitive mood, objective tone, and narrative form with text paragraphs


Febuary 1st 2023:
  Once again, two leading hypotheses:
    Volcanism and impact event (asteroid)

    The "great dying" mass extinciton at time of siverian LIP

      Around 95% of marine species were eliminated

      the K-pg mass extinction eliminated 75% of species

      4 evidence types for impact event:
        - iridium (Underwent planetary differentiation, asteroids have them beause they are too small to differentiate)
        - shocked quartz (only forms at very high pressure)
        - tektities (formed from molten rock droplets)

      Where did that large asterioid impact earth 66 million years ago?

      Environmental consequences:
        1. Energy released 
        2. Regional:
            - Earthquakes (>10 magnitude)
            - Tsunamis
        3. Global:
            Vaporize rocks - Co2 sulfric accident


  K-pg extinction:
    A double wammy of LIP and an asteroid event

    The K-pg was the only one with strong evidence for impact

    Was the permian triassic extinction also a double wammy?

  We gotta think about reccurance intervals when discussing impact events:
    big ones happen +/- 100 million years

February 2 2023:

  Purpose / Gap

  Why are you writing this report?

  What gap in solutions, information, etx, needs to be bridged?

  History or background:
    What kind of background knowledge is needed to understand this topic?

  What will this report cover?
    Overview report structure

  High context:
    have subject knowledge; reader's responsibility to understand information provided

    low context:
      little subject knowldege; writer's responsibility to clarify information
      (it is your responsibility to understand something because that writing is prob in your field)

Febuary 7th 2023:

  Translation strategies:
    Determine level of language you need to start with 

    Define unframiliar terms

    HC audience:
      facts and figures require little explanation 
      formulas and equations used
      jardon used (including measurments) 
      high technicality 
      high level of precisions for measurments

    LC audience:
      used simplified word choices
      define key concpets
      limit the number of ideas per sentence or sections,
      use explicit transitions, headings, and lists
      use Descriptions
      explain the importance or signifance for the target Audience
      use greater degree of abstraction

    looking at example:
      how they failed:
        using some unframiliar terms (propogation)


      what they did good:
        created a summary at the end


  Definitions are used in technical writing
    - to define new concepts, technologies, design species, ideas, words 

    - Paranthetical definition example (usually in parantheases):
      this call requires students to have tgeir own laptops (a small, portable computer)
    
    - Sentence defintion example:
      A laptop is a computer with its own battery source and is portable

    - Excerpt from a expanded defintion example:
      NOOOO

  Expanded definition:
    Consider why this concept would be important to highlight/expand for your audience

  Ways to expand:
    - etymology
    - history 
    - negation
    - compare/contrast
    - required conditions
    - analysis of parts
    - variation/types
    - examples
    - visuals
    - operating principles

  How to format a good docuemnt:
    - Make good use of all available space (remember that IB Bio research paper)
    - Apply parrallelism (for example, in a table of contents)
    - keep margins consistent 
    - Use specific images, showing the different components of your topic
    - introduce image beforehand

  Visual benefits:
    - Processed 60,000x faster (1/10th second)
    - helps with long-term memory
    - wider audience comprehension

    Visuals:
      - Offer a break from the Text 
      - capture and gold people's attention 
      - ....

    Types of visuals:
      TABLES or figures

    FIGURES can take many forms and incude:
      - graphs
      - charts
      - pictures
      - illustrations, such as maps and diagrams

    figures are labeled below, and tables are above

    Bars and line graphs:
      show change over time 

      ....

    Pie charts:
      display how a whole is divided

      Show a relationship between the part and the whole

    Gannt chart:

    Flow chart:
    Diagrams or drawings:
      - focus on important Features
      - show spatial relationships
      - call attention to details
      - show process

  procedural writing:
    procedures-industry standard instructions

  Instructions - tell how to perform a particular task

  process Descriptions - describe how something works (parts and interactions)
  
    First consider the rhetorical situation:
      - who? how skilled are they?
      - what are they doing?
      - when/where/why are they performing this task

    The purpose of step by step is to create accessibility 

    Include process Descriptions

    Safety information:
      Danger 

      Warning

      Caution

    Instruction parts:
      Clear Title (How to... How to put together...) Doesnt need to have a "how to" just be very specific 

      Be very specific (not just read top dial... dead TOP left dial (in red))

    Paragraph principles:
      1. have a unified focus
      2. show focus in an opening claim
      3. arrange information to aid reading
      4. eliminiate ideaa that shift focus
      5. develop ideas sufficienty
      

      3 -> 6 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5

      Use known to new information (when writing paragraphs) --> this is a key technical writing principle 

      GRAMMAR TIPS:
        PREDICATE: The part of a sentence that indicates
        - what the subject does 
        - what happens to the subject 
        - what is said about the subject 

        Sentence:
          - subject 
          - predicate 
          - complete idea 

        Sentence fragment:
          "BECAUSE ONE OF MY FRIENDS WON A CONTEST BY PLAYING A VARIETY OF INTSTRUMENTS" 
            This is a dependant clause and thus a sentence fragment when by itself

        Run on sentence:
          A lot of sentences put together without proper punctuation

        comma splice:
          a random comma in between sentences

        Semicolons:
          Join together two independant clauses (place equal weight on each sentence)

        Complex sentence: 
          A sentence with a depdendant and independant clause


        Coordinated conjuction:
          (but, and or, for, yet, so)
  
        Use of colons:
          Setting up a list:
            - I ordered the following supplies: coffee, straws, and napkins

            - setting up emphasis:
              the jury finally reached a verdict: guilty 

            - settting up an example, quote, or expanded explanation

    - explore possible strategies
    - act on best solution 
    - look back and learn (adapt)

   Problem:
    - how do you know this is a problem?
    - why us there a need for this project, research, etc.
    - why is this a problem? what are the consequences
    - What acaused the problem? Sole or contriburory causes? 
    - Proximate and remote causes?

      - Remote cause (Indirect cause)

      - Promixate cause (direct cause)

    Audience:
      Who has the power to solve the problem individual or group?
      why hasnt the problem been solved to this point?
      consider all the stakeholders as you brainstorm, research, and write: people who affect or are affected by the problem

    Research Options:
      - online database
      - government reports & documents 
      - credible websites
      - experts in the field/scholarly sources 
      - newspapers / trade magazines
      - your own research...

    Evaluate Project Feasibility:
      - Cost-benefits analysis
      - who's gonna fund it 
      - who will implement it?
      - where with supplies come from 
      - is there any special expertise required?
      - how long will it take?
      - is any special permission required
      - will it truly meet the needs of a majority of the people involved 
      - will it address the problem, but create more prolbem in the process?

    Evidence Solution:
      Evidence Solution will address the problem and is the best option

      - vivid accounts
      - causual reasoning
      - analogy
      - precedent 
      - primary findings

      So what? Why?
        how have you been indicted to action vs agreement?
          - insentive/benefit
          - avoiding consequences

        why you shouldn't do it:
          - too difficult
          - differing value

  MKLeo
    - identifies that light is playing more patiently 
    - the context is very dire, he's gotta reverse 3-0 
   - he thinks of stronger combo routes and goes for aggressive ledge gaurding options
    - acts on his improved gameplan 
    - looks back on his mistakes from previous games and adapts to improve his existing gameplan

this happened after this event, so this must be the cause of it 
(CORRELATION DOES NOT EQUAL CAUSATION)


Toulmine method:
  Claims: statesment of fact, opinion, or belief that provide 
  Qualifiers: one or more statements that limit or clarify the claim 
  warrants: links from the claim to reasons and evidence 
  Evidence: yup
  rebuttle:
    refute it...
    concede it...

  Fallacies
    error in argument:
      Qualifying claims (may vs always)
      Assess (the relationship between claims)
      Evaluate (claims, reasoning, and evidence)
