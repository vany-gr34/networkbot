"the us governments cybersecurity defenses are under strain after the white housebacked department of government efficiency doge abruptly terminated key contracts, leading to the dismantling of two red teams within the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency cisa. the move has sparked concerns about the federal governments ability to defend against cyber threats amid increasing geopolitical tensions. the layoffs, which affected more than 100 cybersecurity specialists, were disclosed by former cisapenetration testerchristopher chenoweth, who revealed on linkedin that doge had scrapped the contract supporting his red team and a second critical team within days. on friday, february 28, 2025, at 1600 hours, the government contract i supported with cisa dept of homeland security was terminated due to doge,chenoweth wrote in the linkedin post. doge cut our entire red team and all support roles over 100 people impacted. the following wednesday, doge cut a second cisa red team also doing missioncritical work. these teams were tasked with identifying vulnerabilities in government networks and strengthening national cybersecurity defenses. their sudden dismissal raises questions about the biden administrations cybersecurity strategy and whether budget cuts are compromising national security. chenoweth is not the only one to go vocal about what is happening at cisa. the treatment that we are being given right now is enough to cause me and my family soulcrushing loss, kelly shaw, a former employee of cisa wrote in anotherlinkedin post. our dreams are being shattered, our livelihood is being destroyed, and our nation will be less secure all because of some quick political points being scored. shaw had joined cisa from naval intelligence three years ago and was part of the cybersentry program. more than 130 people from this division were fired in the last week of february. on february 14th, i received an email from someone i had never heard of telling me that i was not meeting the needed knowledge, skills, and abilities, shaw narrated. my 30 years of network experience, two internet service provider businesses, 14 years of federal service to the nation, education, and performance appraisals say otherwise. jen easterly, the former director of cisa, too had raised concerns about what is happening at the premier cybersecurity agency. as i understand it and to be fair, it is an imperfect understanding from someone who is now on the outside, some folks have been justifiably let go for performance reasons and exceptions have been made for others,easterly wrote in a linkedin post.but as ive seen across this platform over the past week, the exceptions are not preventing some fantastic teammates from being fired. doge, an oversight unit established by elon musk and endorsed by the trump administration, has been aggressively eliminating federal contracts, claiming toreduce government waste. while its public records list 86 canceled contracts at the department of homeland security dhs, it does not explicitly mention penetration testing, leaving uncertainty over the justification behind the cybersecurity team layoffs. adding to concerns, other critical cybersecurity programs have also been defunded, including the elections infrastructure information sharing and analysis center eiisac. the center, which provided cyber threat intelligence to election officials and state agencies,announcedits closure after dhs pulled its funding. meanwhile, the multistate information sharing and analysis center msisac, a 20yearold cybersecurity collaboration hub between federal, state, and local governments, is also at risk of losing support. analysts suggest these layoffs and funding cuts indicate a broader strategic shift in the u.s. governments cybersecurity approach. neil shah, vp at counterpoint research, sees both risks and opportunities in the restructuring. in the near to midterm, this could weaken the us cybersecurity infrastructure. however, with ai proliferating, the us government likely has a plan b potentially shifting toward privatized cybersecurity infrastructure projects, similar to what were seeing with project stargate for ai, shah said. if these gaps arent filled with viable alternatives, vulnerabilities could escalate from smallscale exploits to largescale cyber incidents at state or federal levels. signs point to a broader cybersecurity strategy reboot, with funding likely being redirected toward more efficient and sophisticated players rather than a purely vertical, governmentled approach. while some fear heightened risks, others argue the shift could lead to more techdriven solutions. faisal kawoosa, founder and lead analyst at techarc, views the move as part of a larger digital transformation. elon musks role is not just about costcutting but also about leveraging technology to create more efficient systems, kawoosa said. doge operates as a digital transformation program for us governance, exploring techfirst approaches to achieving similar or better results. he added that such a significant decision was unlikely without an impact assessment. i dont foresee a major security threat arising from this shift. while initial gaps may appear, given musks rapid execution style, it wont take long for a new system to deliver comparable or improved outcomes. yugal joshi, a partner at everest group, expressed skepticism over dismantling key cybersecurity initiatives amid increasing global threats. given the polarizing and increasingly vulnerable global environment, it is hard to believe the us government is dismantling such key organizations, joshi said. critical infrastructure across the globe, especially in the us, faces constant threats, and cisas red team played a crucial role in defense. winding up cisas red team and msisac may cause more harm than shutting down eiisac, given their broader and more critical roles. while he warned of longterm consequences, joshi acknowledged a possible silver lining. this move could be detrimental in the long run. however, an overlap of federal and state cybersecurity responsibilities might make states better prepared if they receive adequate funding. it could also lead to a more accountable approach, reducing unchecked spending. he further noted that should a major cyber incident occur, it would serve as a validation of cisas importance. if something significant happens, it will prove to critics that these departments were indeed creating value, something that was always under scrutiny. as the federal government continues its restructuring under doges directive, the longterm consequences of these cybersecurity cutbacks remain uncertain. security experts warn that the us could be significantly more vulnerable to evolving cyber threats, unless new systems swiftly bridge the gaps left behind. gyana is a contributing writer. sponsored

"crooks behind somecredentialstealingphishing campaigns are trying to increase their success rate by sophisticated targeting. according to researchers at cofense, instead of blasting out mass messages to a list of email addresses theyve collected or bought, these threat actors only target addresses that have been verified as active, legitimate, and often highvalue. cofense calls the technique precisionvalidated phishing, or realtime email validation, and it works like this when someone who falls for a pitch attempts to access the crooks phishing page, their email address is checked against the attackers database, via javascriptbased validation scripts on the page, before the fraudulent credential stealing login form is displayed. if the email address entered does not match any from the predefined list, the phishing page either returns an error or redirects to a legitimate, benignlooking, page. if the address is confirmed, however, the fake login page that can capture the victims credentials is displayed. the problem facing defenders is the tactic prevents security teams from doing further analysis and investigation, says thecofense report. automated security crawlers and sandbox environments also struggle to analyze these attacks because they cannot bypass the validation filter, the report adds. also, the report says, the selective nature of these attacks makes detection through threat intelligence sharing more difficult. since the phishing pages do not serve malicious content to everyone, some traditional url scanning tools may fail to flag them as threats. this undermines traditional blocklisting efforts, requiring organizations to shift toward behavioural analysis and anomaly detection to identify phishing campaigns before they reach end users, the report says. david shipley, head of canadianbased security awareness training firm beauceron security, said theres a little bit of hype in giving the tactic a fancy name for what is in factspear phishing, although, he admitted, its rapidfire spear phishing. the reason, he said, is that sprayandpray mass phishing campaigns today are being detected by email gateways. this is why threat actors have increasingly turned to spear phishing and what he calls trolling campaigns, where the goal is to measure who will report a phishing attempt, who will click, and where on the message the target will click. theyre trying to figure things out ahead of doing something clever, he said. the report is a reminder to infosec pros that, despite improved defenses, phishing is still a prime tactic of threat actors, shipley said. you can have a false sense of security if youre running a large enterprise and say, we stopped 950,000 phishing emails this month. but the 500 that got through could really sink the battleship. the lesson for cisos, he added, is to emphasize to employees the importance of reporting suspected phishing emails instead of just deleting them. this is very difficult to defend against, said johannes ullrich, dean of research at the sans institute. the first step is to restrict javascript access. next, mail servers need to rate limit requests to restrict how often a particular source may use its api. but it is very difficult to find the right rate limit. the only real solution, he said, is to move away from traditional credentials to phishingsafe authentication methods likepasskeys. the goal should be to protect from leaked credentials, not block user account verification. attackers verifying email addresses as deliverable, or being associated with specific individuals, is nothing fundamentally new, he added. initially, attackers used the mail servers vrfy command to verify if an address was deliverable. this still works in a few cases. next, attackers relied on nondeliverable receipts, the bounce messages you may receive if an email address does not exist, to figure out if an email address existed. both techniques work pretty well to determine if an email address is deliverable, but they do not distinguish whether the address is connected to a human, or if its messages are read. the next step, ullrich said, was sending obvious spam, but including an unsubscribe link. if a user clicks on the unsubscribe link, it confirms that the email was opened and read. so current advice is to not use the unsubscribe link unless you know the organization sending the email, he said. with web mail systems, it is often possible for a threat actor to figure out if a particular account exists by just attempting to log in, he noted. the attacker may get a different response if the account doesnt exist, versus incorrect password for an existing account. for public systems like gmail or hotmail, an attacker may also attempt to create a new account, and the system will warn them if a particular username is already taken. it looks like this campaign added the ability to verify if an email address exists in real time, he said. most webmail systems are built around apis accessible from javascript, and an attacker can use these apis or create a database of valid email addresses or some middleware to proxy the requests to the email services api in case they restrict javascript access. howard solomon is a torontobased freelance reporter who has written on it and cybersecurity issues for a number of publications over the past 25

"a chinese cyberespionage group with a history of exploiting proprietary networkedge devices and developing custom malware for them has also been targeting enterprise and ispgrade juniper mx series routers, according to a report by googles mandiant team. the attackers were able to bypass the file integrity protections of junos os, the freebsdbased operating system used on juniper networks routers, to deploy custom backdoors. this activity, attributed to anadvanced persistent threatapt group that mandiant team tracks as unc3886, dates back to at least the middle of 2024 and seems to have affected juniper mx routers that were running endoflife hardware and software versions. the use of endoflife networking hardware, while definitely not recommended, is not unusual on internal networks, considering budget constraints and the significant costs associated with replacing such devices. while unc3886 previously focused their operations on network edge devices, this activity demonstrated theyre also targeting internal networking infrastructure, such as internet service provider isp routers, the mandiant researchers saidin their report. mandiant observed the threat actor targeting network authentication services, including the terminal access controller accesscontrol system tacacs, and terminal servers with access to the routers to gain privileged initial access. malware implants deployed on the analyzed devices were variants of the publicly available tinyshell backdoor, but with added functionality and customizations that show the attackers had an indepth knowledge of junos os features and internal operations. unc3886 has displayed such productspecific knowledge before, having previouslycreated custom malware for vmware esxi hypervisorsandnetworkedge devices from fortinet and ivanti. while unc3886 is tracked as a standalone group, some tooling overlap with other chinese statesponsored groups such as apt41 was observed in the past althoughtool and infrastructure sharing is a longstanding hallmark of chinese cyberespionage. mandiant recommends that organizations upgrade their juniper devices to the latest imagesreleasedby juniper networks, which includes mitigations and updated signatures for thejuniper malware removal tooljmrt, researchers said. organizations should run the jmrt quick scan and integrity check after the upgrade. attackers initial access to the juniper mx routers analyzed by mandiant seems to have been achieved with legitimate credentials. while unc3886 has developed and used zeroday exploits to compromise networkedge devices in the past, the group actively performs credential collection on compromised networks for lateral movement to support its goal of longterm persistent access. junos os provides administrators with a custom commandline interface cli that allows issuing junos specific commands, but also the ability to switch to the underlying freebsd shell and use the general freebsd commandline tools and programs. the os also implements a modified variant of the netbsd verified exec veriexec, a kernelbased file integrity verification subsystem whose goal is to protect against the execution of unauthorized binaries. as such, deploying and running any malware implant requires a bypass of this feature or disabling it entirely, which could raise alerts. unc3886 developed a complex process injection technique in order to bypass variexec by creating a hung process using the builtin and legitimate cat utility, writing a malicious shellcode loader to specific memory locations assigned to the cat process and then tricking the process to execute that code. since the malicious code execution happened through a trusted process, variexec was bypassed. the shellcode loader was then used to execute a position independent code pic variant of tinyshell stored in a file called lmpad, which mimicks the name of the legitimate lmpd link management protocol daemon process. in addition to the standard tinyshell capabilities remote file upload, remote file download and remote shell session the lmpad variant can hook into two legitimate junos os processes to disable logging before a remote operator connects to the backdoor. the main purpose of this malware is to disable all possible logging before the operator connects to the router to perform handson activities and then later restore the logs after the operator disconnects, the researchers said. the backdoor contains five custom commands. in addition to the default tinyshell functionality, these allow the disabling and restoring of logging functions, the encryption of the interactive shell session traffic over udp, the backup and restore of the juniper router configuration database and updating the communication socket timeout value. but lmpad is just one of six different tinyshell variants that unc3886 deployed on various compromised routers. each of these had significantly different customizations and junosrelated capabilities added to them. another variant called appid masquerading as the legitimate appidd application identification daemon is an active backdoor in addition to being a passive one that waits for incoming connections. the backdoor actively tries to establish connection with a list of four hardcoded ip addresses that are part of an orb network and point to a commandandcontrol c2 server. operational relay box orb networks are essentially botnets of compromised devices and virtual private servers that are used to proxy malicious traffic. they have become a commonly used asset by chinese cyberespionage groups in recent year and their goal is to complicate attribution. another instance of this tinyshell variant with different hardcoded c2 ip addresses was observed with the file name to, which likely mimics the legitimate binary called top table of processes. a fourth variant, using the name irad, implements a libpcapbased packet sniffer to monitor traffic over all network interfaces and wait for a magic packet in an icmp echo request to activate its active backdoor functionality. the fifth variant, jdosd was likely named after the juniper ddos protection daemon jddosd process and is a passive backdoor implementation that binds to udp port 33512 and uses a custom rc4 implementation to encrypt traffic. finally, sample six, called oemd after the legitimate operation, administration, and maintenance daemon oamd, communicated with the c2 server over tcp instead of udp and the traffic is encrypted with aes. its configuration is stored in environment variables. all the samples use a custom afroute socket to communicate with the os routing subsystem. this socket uses custom messages and is specific to junos os. running the samples on a standard freebsd installation would result in an invalid socket error, making it clear that these samples were created specifically for junos os and the attackers have spent time understanding the os networking internals. the compromise of routing devices is a recent trend in the tactics of espionagemotivated adversaries as it grants the capability for a longterm, highlevel access to the crucial routing infrastructure, with a potential for more disruptive actions in the future, the mandiant researchers warned. a concerted effort is required to safeguard these critical systems and ensure the continued stability and security of the internet. another reason why attackers are going after such devices is because they generally lack advanced security monitoring and detection capabilities, such as the ability to deploy endpoint detection and response edr agents on them. the google threat intelligence and mandiant team make the following recommendations in order to better protect such devices lucian

"two of the top three vulnerabilities that threat actors tried to leverage in 2024 were in end of life eol network devices that manufacturers have stopped issuing patches for, says a new report. this underscores the importance of decommissioning and replacing eol components of an organizations network as soon as possible, says the2024 annual reportfrom cisco systems talos threat intelligence unit, released monday. the two holes cve20243273 and cve20243272, in network attached storage devices from dlink, combined with a third cve202424919 in check point softwares quantum security gateways, accounted for more half of the network devices vulnerabilities by volume that threat actors used last year. many of these vulnerabilities have largely been exploited by knownbotnetslikemirai, gafgyt, and others, which can establish control over the compromised devices and command them to carry out distributed denialofservice ddos attacks and other malicious activity, says the report. because of the access that routers, firewalls, and other network devices afford, their compromise can allow an attacker to easily move laterally, carry out other phases of their attacks, and potentially take over entire networks. at least one of the vulnerabilities cve202338035 has been exploited by ransomware operators. others on the top 10 list were many threat actors are still profiting from breaking into networks through old and unpatched holes, the report added. it said that four of the top 12 common vulnerabilities cves attackers used in attacks were published a decade ago. they include these are, however, the vulnerabilities most used in attempts, and not a measure of which were successful, the report stressed. still, the report authors said, the numbers are a stark reminder that threat actors frequently target unpatched systems, and failure to apply security updates leaves organizations vulnerable to many attacks that could otherwise be prevented. that conclusion matches very much what the sans institute is seeing from its internet storm center sensors, said johannes ullrich, the institutes dean of research. currently the number one vulnerability we see exploited is just about two years old to the day cve202326801, a vulnerability in lblink wireless routers followed bycve202230023, an authenticated command injection on tenda hg9 routers. i think the issue is most obvious when looking at how consistent the passwords are that attackers are attempting to brute force, ullrich added. this list has not changed much in probably 20 years. the reason for it is simple people have a hard time to patch. in particular home devices and routers are usually only patched by a power surge forcing the user to replace them, he said. apaches log4j logging library is one of the most widely used opensource programs in the world, the report notes. while the four vulnerabilities, collectively known as log4shell, were patched shortly after discovery, they will likely pose a longterm risk for organizations because log4j is so deeply embedded in the software supply chain. the us department of homeland security, the report stressed, estimates it will take at least a decade to find and fix every vulnerable instance. the special concern about php is because between 75 and 80 of the worlds two billion websites rely on the language, including popular sites like facebook and wikipedia and ecommerce platforms like etsy and shopify, the report says. the shellshock vulnerability is a concern because bash is integrated deeply into applications and system processes globally, says the report. it also points out that many web servers, routers and internetofthings iot devices rely on bash to execute commands, meaning that vulnerable devices connected to the internet are potential targets. these hardware components are often less frequently updated or harder to patch, especially in industrial or critical infrastructure settings, the report noted. shellshocks direct consequences may not have been as catastrophic as other highprofile breaches and cyber attacks, the report authors admit, but it is a persistent problem. for example, in 2019, talos discovered a global statesponsored espionage campaign called sea turtle that manipulated dns records to gain access to sensitive systems. the adversary relied on several vulnerabilities, including shellshock, to gain initial access. while other confirmed public examples of statesponsored cyber actors targeting shellshock are limited, its very likely that other advanced actors have attempted to exploit shellshock. says the report. many wellknown adversaries like the russian statesponsored group apt28 and north korean statesponsored lazarus group exploit critical vulnerabilities in widely used software, making shellshock a likely tool in their broader espionage and attack campaigns, say the authors. in the report, talos offered its top 10 tips for securing network devices. it recommends

"asus is urging customers with aicloud enabled on their asus routers to immediately upgrade firmware against a critical vulnerability that allows unauthorized activities by remote actors. tracked as cve20252492, the vulnerability is an authentication bypass issue receiving a critical severity rating of cvss 9.2 out of 10. an improper authentication control vulnerability exists in certain asus router firmware series, the gaming and networking hardware giant said in anadvisory. this vulnerability can be triggered by a crafted request, potentially leading to unauthorized execution of functions. asus aicloud is a cloudbased service enabled by default in many asus routers that allows certain remote functions, including accessing files remotely from any device with internet, syncing files between routers and connected storage like a usb drive, connecting to the home network remotely, and syncing files with connected cloud services like dropbox. asus confirmed the vulnerability affecting a wide line of devices, issuing patches for multiple firmware series, including 3.0.0.4382, 3.0.0.4386, 3.0.0.4388, and 3.0.0.6102. a possible workaround for customers unable to apply patches could be to ensure stronger login and wifi passwords, the company added. additionally, asus recommended disabling aicloud and any service that can be accessed from the internet, such as remote access from wan, port forwarding, ddns, vpn server, dmz port triggering, and ftp, as an alternative to applying fixes. use different passwords for your wireless network and routeradministration page, asus said. use passwords that have at least 10 characters, with a mix of capital letters, numbers, and symbols. do not use the same password for more than one device or service. do not use passwords with consecutive numbers or letters. while asus did not reveal if the flaw was exploited in the wild, a successful abuse of the issue could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access and execute critical router functions, potentially leading to a network compromise and data exfiltration. asus routers and the underlying firmware have had a handful of hightocritical severity mishaps in the recent past, with a couple of them abused in the wild. most critical of these bugs include a remote authentication bypass flaw cve20243080 allowing full control over affected routers, and an arbitrary firmware upload issue cve20243912 allowing arbitrary command execution. one of the most dramatic moments in asus security history came in 2019, when attackers managed tosneak a backdoored versionof an official asus application onto the companys own update servers. the malicious software was picked up by over a million unsuspecting users, turning the incident into a massive supply chain compromise. shweta sharma is a senior journalist covering enterprise information security and digital ledger technologies for idgs cso online, computerworld, and other enterprise sites. sponsored links",https://www.csoonline.com/article/3966073/asus-patches-critical-router-flaw-that-allows-remote-attacks.html
