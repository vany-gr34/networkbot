SIEM tools for network events,"hello guys, i am still learning networking and i just had this idea and wondering if this is already implemented but i dont know about it . this is my rough idea to create a network protocol , and with this, every switch will execute show spanningtreesupports all flavors and show lldp neighbours commands and even portchannels details , and include it in the packet and pass it to root bridge , lets say after every 30 sec. or instead of executing those commands just get data from sysdb like in arista switches and on root bridge , ill collect this packet and a simple script parse those details to a json file and i have a tool that can create a nice ui topology from this data. so, i have seen people in tac teams , that many times customers dont really provide topologies , or even for network designers , if a new guy comes in and he wanted to know the topology this could help right ? is this good idea ? is this already made ? e well, well, well, after reading comments , i realize that its already implemented this was a bad idea i guess || isnt all of this already available via snmp normaly? and how would you implement this on propriatary hardware software? || of course software like this already exists but they dont use stp as not every network is using it but instead use lldp, cdp and whatever other discovery protocols to find management ips. you either give it an ip range and credentials or a single device and credentials from which it will discover and log in into neighbouring devices and collect data. my goto software for ohh, lets get a topology of this network and an inventory of all devices and ports is netdisco || check out librenms. it autodiscovers by lldp once you add one switch and automatically creates network topology diagrams."
SIEM tools for network events,"hi networking folks, ive recently inherited an aws cloud environment thats... lets just say, full of surprises. its a mix of legacy and inprogress migration workloads. every other day were firefighting because systems cant talk to each other, sometimes its route table issues, sometimes security groups, sometimes traffic blackholed in transit gateway or lost in a firewall appliance. what im really looking for is a tool that can visualize traffic flows in aws. something that lets me see which eni is talking to which eni whether its flowing through transit gateway which security group or nacl it hits if its being handled or blocked by a 3rd party firewall appliance like palo alto or fortinet bonus if its affordable or open source, and if nothing good exists, im seriously considering building one. maybe even turning it into a product. anyone here using something like this? or building one? would love to hear what tools you use, or what you wish existed. thanks in advance! || freeopensource that would work natively to gather public cloud traffic. public cloud are black box, you cant really monitor it like classic network infra."
SIEM tools for network events,"i have been searching to try and find an answer but i keep coming up blank. so any thoughts will be appreciated. i have asked both dell software support and dell networking but neither of them has an answer. the networking group does not have any best practice for how to setup the switch for use with hyperv to best take advantage of vlt networking. i have dell pro support plus on all my equipment. the dell network team says it is a hyperv question on how they want it setup. the dell software support says this is a dell networking question and they both think they are independent. i am running hyperv and using powershell to create a virtual set using hypervport for load balancing. i have a 3 node cluster running 75 virtual servers on the cluster set does not support lacp my hyperv host are connected to two dell switches that are running dell os10 setup with vlt all servers are the same the following is an example of one server 1 connected to switch 1 with 2 ports connected to switch 2 with 2 ports all 4 ports on server 1 are in a single set virtual switch i have added host os, cluster network and backup network as virtual nics off the main set so the os sees the host os, cluster network and backup network iscsi is on dedicated nics that are not part of set and are using mpio with a nic connected to each switch. to best handle efficient routing of traffic between virtual servers and fast notification of down link events what is the preferred method of setup from the switch side of the equation. i run 10 rds session host servers using fslogix for profile storage so network latency matters to give my users a good experience. option 1 do nothing on the ports at the switch level. this requires that all traffic be routed and can put a lot of traffic on the backplane of the vlti interface between the switches because it does not optimize traffic. option 2 setup a port channel with lacp set to static. this will communicate to the vlt switches the group of ports are together for routing and notification and not creating loops. my understanding is this also helps with routing of traffic and notification during loss of 1 switch i.e. maintenance windows for switch. option 3 doing an lbfo nic team that does support lacp then apply the set switch to the team was an option but is not the recommended method from microsoft. also this only gives you one vmmq because the set only sees one nic so it cannot take advantaged of all 4 nics for offloading traffic. option 4 some other method best load balancing for vlt switches vnic is the guest nic and pnic is the physical nic currently all my virtual servers have 1 vnic best practice from microsoft is to use hypervport for all 10gb or faster nics. option 1 hypervport this basically sets a vm to a card the distribution is done by the os and just load them up in a round robin fashion. this vnic1 connects to pnic1 vnic2 connects to pnic2 vnic3 connects to pnic3 vnic4 connects to pnic4 vnic5 connects to pnic1 etc. option 2 dynamic the traffic from vnics gets send out on all 4 pnics in round robin but only one pnic can receive traffic. i do not know if it the process is smart enough to know that it is talking with a vm guest that also on the same switch then it would only send out on the pnics that are connected with that same switch. this could generate a lot of traffic on the vlti backplane if half of the packets are coming from the other switch. i must be over thinking this which is not unusual for me but the lack of documentation is pretty astounding considering this technology has been around for 10 years. || vlt seems to be the dell version of vpc. dont do anything on the switches, set is switch independent and works fine as is. || yep. no fancy config on switches. how load is balanced and bandwidth utilized depends on if the port is set to dynamic or hyper v. you should probably use hyperv port for your vms. refer to the guide from lenovo below which details set requirements and setup for hyperconverged. it is the same for converged, but includes rdma setup. microsoft also has documentation on this on learn.microsoft.com. || yes you dont really do any lag or anything. just present the ports and set itself will handle it."
SIEM tools for network events,"i have a customer who we did a network design for just over a year ago. we talked them through all the pros and cons as part of the design process and they selected to terminate all the vlans onto their cisco switches and then just have a layer 3 transit up to the firewall. this firewall was easy to spec as it was essentially just a case of how big are your internet pipes, how much might they grow over the next 56 years. boom there is a firewall. we are now 12 months layer and they are saying we want to terminate all the vlans and they have a lot, and want more onto the firewall. i agree this is a superior and potentially more secure design but i suspect if we do this it will just overload the firewall as it just wasnt speced for that use case. the customer, and rightfully so, is saying give us some figures to backup that statement. that got me thinking.... what is the best way to do this? my initial thought process is put netflow in on the core switch and look at the traffic levels between the various vlans. we could also monitor the traffic levels on the svis its a cisco core switch and see what traffic levels they get. currently the customer is using prtg but is there some other tools that could give us better reporting? but what does reddit think? what have i missed? what else could i consider? ||  || you dont say anything about the fw capabilities. its very difficult to answer the question in the title if you dont specify the firewall itself. and i do agree with other comments it all depends what you want to do with the traffic when it hits the firewall. do you just want to do regular l4 filtering or are they going with something like l7 filtering appid with pa, ssl decryption? are you going to employ security profiles to filter ew traffic as well? is the firewall doing any ipsec tunneling or ravpn? basically, its not just the amount of traffic, its also what youre going to do with it. newer fortigates and pa series starting with 400 series are small beasts and can handle a lot of abuse of course, the more you need, the higher you go on the ladder when speccing the fw as well. as for routing, i disagree with some of the comments unless youre talking about very specific routing usually reserved for datacenters, firewalls are more than capable of doing it, at least major vendors in the field are. if youre talking about just intervlan routing, then double that. ive been in networking field for past 20 years, last 10 years mostly security engineering firewalls and unless im working with a very specific type of a company that absolutely needs to have line speed for intervlan traffic, all vlans are terminated on the firewall, no exception im done with the days of 2010 years ago when i was trying to figure out which acl on a switch is blocking something. || group networks inside a vrf and use the firewall as the gateway. this reduces the number of vlans on the firewall and allows east west between like networks with minimal security concern."
SIEM tools for network events,"hello everyone! ive recently been put in charge of a complete network replacement project at my company, taking over from a colleague whos no longer involved. while i have a technical background, this is my first time leading a project of this scale, and id really appreciate any advice from those of you whove been through something similar. the scope of the project includes designing a new network topology cleaning up existing racks and cable closets reorganizing patch panels, switches, and getting cable management under control replacing legacy switches with new ones and configuring them to support the updated network design right now, im trying to figure out what questions i should be asking, what to prioritize, and which common pitfalls to watch out for. heres what id love your input on what would your first steps be in a project like this? any templates, tools, or documentation methods you find invaluable? any common mistakes youve seen or made during network overhauls? thanks in advance any insight would be hugely appreciated! || ive wrapped up a network overhaul a month ago for one of our facilities and its my favorite project to do. i work in the manufacturing industry and oversee at least 6 facilities, and have led at least a dozen infrastructure overhauls. handling a project and seeing it through will require detailed planning and clear communication to stakeholders to help minimizeprevent unplanned issues. we still do things manuallyoldschool, nothing fancy. general overview 1. break down the project into small actionable tasks and identify who will be handling what. 2. document and review your network infrastructure logical and physical. identify and label critical portscables. i like to create a table where one column lists the connections from the patch panel to the current port interface, and a separate column lists where theyll be connecting to on the new network switch. i also like using visio to create visual diagram mapping 3. identify what services will be affected, so that these can be communicated to management. 4. review and verify current configs are backed up. then check the current configs will be able to apply on new switch or if you may need to write up a new template. 5. keep in mind the environment power, environment, humidity, etc. are you adding new idf? if also factor in accessibility to idf. 6. on the day of cutover or before cutover, do a final plan review with stakeholders to make sure any litle detaillast minutes changes went unnoticed and everything verbalizedcommunicated so that all individuals are on agreement. we had to involve devop team and our consultants to make sure their applications and services are safely shutdown, then resumed and verified. past mistakes that were madeissues experienced 1. incompatible hardware were orderedreceived. just doublecheck the specs sheets. 2. insufficient cables 3. the one time i forgo a final plan review previous network projects went without any hiccup, we ran into technicals that extended the outage by an hour past planned outage widnows. 4. unclear communication. be direct and concise in communication. vague and wordy communication will cause the team to fumble. feel free to message me for questions and support!"
SIEM tools for network events,"hello everyone, i have a situation id like to discuss, and im curious if anyone has encountered something similar. the network topology involves ospf mpls mpbgp r1 rr cost 1 r3 r2 rr cost 20 r3 r1 rr cost 1 r2 rr there is an xconnect established between r3 and r1, as well as a backup pseudowire set up between r3 and r2. in the event of a link failure between r3 and r1, the primary pseudowire remains up because r3 can still reach r1 via r2. however, an issue arises in this setup. icmp works fine, but web traffic does not. the problem manifests as if its related to mtu, even though the mtu on the pseudowires is set to 9100, and a 1500byte ping with the df bit set passes through the pseudowire without any issues. am i missing something here? has anyone experienced a similar situation? thanks in advance for any insights! || have you done any captures yet? whats the mss of the tcp segments? 1460? how far do those packets make it? do you see any issues when using something like iperf to test? || double check all the interfaces in the path have an mtu at or above the pw mtu."

SIEM tools for network events,"i work for a live events organisation and weve been tasked with deploying 300 controllable fixtures across a 3km outdoor site. usually these are controlled by dmx, cat6, or fibre but all of these become unfeasible at this scale as they are either too far for copper cables too expensive and risky to run fibre challenging to keep safe and out of the way of the general public were on the hunt for a solution that we could deploy across different sites and allows us to create 12 control hubs, all lniked back to a central router where the main controller would live. we functionally need to link 12 computers wirelessly across the 3km site. weve looked into wans, but they require interfacing with the service providers and seem to be fixed locations which is a high cost investment for a temporary installation. wlans would suit the setup, but are limited in range, except for maybe the unifi nanobeams. anyone had experience in something similar? any advice would be hugely appreciated. nb my networking experience is limited to events world, so while we often run managed networks, wireless is somewhat outside our scope. || armored fiber. anything else is a recipe for disaster, especially wifi, especially in a venue with every device in everyones pocket trying to use wifi. now, if you want ethernet over copper over long distances, you have the option of using vdsl2 bridges. i have them out in the field for dmarc extensions and they work great. || when you say fixtures, i assume youre talking about dmx lighting fixtures? i hope that youre not trying to run the actual dmx data wirelessly. to my knowledge, dmx over ethernet is not particularly faulttolerant to wireless systems and will likely get very unhappy very quickly. will each computer connected to a set of fixtures be running the lighting control software locally and youll just be remoting into the pc? if so, thatll probably work fine. dont do something like put a bunch of consoles in session together. protocols like manet tend to slow down the whole session to the slowest node which is bound to cause issues. || the people here who are actually suggesting wireless here are fucking nuts. you do live events, which i assume you mean lots of people. this means lots of devices and interference. they will immediately take over all the wifi channels by connecting to regular facilities wifi, which means your nanobeams will be fighting for channels. the only way you could maybe pull off wireless is if you have a standard it rider you send out to facilities ahead of time and have them block off a range of wifi channels for you. realistically, you just want fiber or ethernet over power. you are already running high voltage power cables to all of your lighting arrays, i assume 110 or 220v is supplied to the lighting racks. you could use powerline ethernet devices which send rf signals over the high voltage lines for point to point ethernet instead of wifi point to point. this will be an order of magnitude more reliable than any wireless solution and will not have interference or contention. alternatively... just do it right. get singlestrand armored singlemode fiber and bidi transceivers. you can buy a simplex os2 patch cable for ultra cheap and just consider it a throw away consumable for each event."
SIEM tools for network events,"hi there, were trialing out sase products with the purpose of locking down saas apps to a centralized gateway, with the intention to split tunnel any other traffic directly not through the gateway. the problem is that, even with split tunnel policies in place to route all traffic normally outoftunnel, were still experiencing delays 30 60 seconds for any event that attempts to contact the domain controller logging in, uac prompts. we also cant join or unjoin from a domain while connected to these sase clientsgateways. note that local non domain joined accounts experience no delays. am i missing something here? why is it that if were setting the traffic to not go through the client, we experience delays? turning off the clientstopping the services fixes the issue. the vendor support hasnt been helpful so far, but youd think this would be a common issue if its affecting domain accounts. note weve tried different domains, networks onprem and offprem, locations, devices, and the problem is consistent || i feel like if you are doing a trial of something and you have to come here to ask that its probably not a vendor you should use. if turning off their client fixes the issue then thats the issue. they would need to explain why. || can you share which solution youre having an issue with? it might help with determining what the issue is, e.g. name resolution, access control, inspection, etc. || im guessing windows clients, do the packets actually get routed out of the device correctly? you could also check the traffic on the gateway, do traceroutes, packet captures with wireguard, check your clients dns settings, gpos or intune configs etc. just saying dns slow is kind of unhelpful, i hope you tried getting their support to gather more info instead of just saying fix pls."
