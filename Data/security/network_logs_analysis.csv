network logs analysis,"hello everyone, i am looking for public database with logs from networks that have quantum connections or classicalquantum interfaces. i have small example of log but need more to analyze. my log shows things like qubit sending through quantum channel qadapter doing qkd before sending packet nodes in classical network connecting with quantum adapters bandwidth used number of hops in network path types of encryption used flow of information between nodes connection times error rates packet sizes latency measurements etc. maybe you know where i can download this type of network logs for learning. thank you very much for your help. || nobody would willingly put their internal logs on a publically accessible database. that makes no sense. || have you tried asking folks with quantum computers? there arent a whole lot of them around. or pay aws to borrow theirs for a bit and run some workloads."
network logs analysis,"so i had this idea to implement a dlp data leakage prevention solution with a mix and match of tools. so the basic idea would have a proxy server capable of intercepting and replaying requests kind of like how burp suite works. route all the traffic from the employee laptops through this proxy server to be able to read all of the network traffic http and included. using these logs, pass it to some analysis engine where i have designed rules to prevent some form of data leakage. i am kinda stuck at the proxy server part, i came across this tool called mitmproxy which pretty much is what i need, it intercepts the requests, then i can write those logs to a file and replay the request back to the server seamlessly but a problem that arises is that mitmproxy is written in python and i am doubtful if it would be able to handle all of that traffic that goes through each employees workstation. i looked into using squidssl bump but it seems pretty complex to set up any suggestions on how to proceed with this? || "
network logs analysis,"hi everyone, i work for a software company and our company has been pushing us to go all in on ai this year. weve had several meetings and there have been some super neat projects that have been shown by various development teams or things of that nature but i feel like i cant find anything useful that we can point to other than stuff weve been using for years like our ncm or firewall related logs alerting us proactively or what not. today we were told that if we arent using ai that we are being left behind and i feel super discouraged because we get asked by our management that we need to show that we are using ai in our daily tasks but yet other than what i mentioned above i cant point to anything. ive been in it for 20 years and been a network engineer for 11 of those and its not that im resistant to change but i dont know where to really start the network is the heart of everything that everyone uses. how are you using ai in your daily work just looking for examples or maybe think outside of the box i feel like im not seeing the big picture or that one thing of here is something cool you can do and implement thanks for reading. || hey chat gpt, here is my private network configuration data, please dont share it with anyone else || i use ai to write emails back to management. technically, it has no real value beyond barfing out error prone snippets. || i dont."
network logs analysis,"as the title says. i was hired at a manufacturing company as an it support specialist very recently, and 2 weeks in i have realized i am actually the it director and the entire it departmentwe do have an msp. i was very clearly told to not answer tickets because i am not help desk, and i have more important things to do. i inherited a mess of a network, and i have to build everything from scratch. the msp charges so much money to help us on our projects, of which there are many because, again, the network is a mess. to start, the network is on nothing but unmanaged switches whose warranties have expired at least 6 years ago, and i am being generous when i say that. we have 3 waps on the first floor, but there is no vlan, so of course wifi is on the same subnet. the switch that is connected to those 3 waps is a small netgear switch with 45 ports, and one port is completely out. we pay for fiber internet, but of course, with the switches being so outdated, we are not even using a third of that speed that is being paid for! because it is a manufacturing company everything is onprem, and the main server is not only a dcaddns. it is also the print server, the license server for the software used by engineers, the file server, the back up for one of the financial software used by the accounting department. if i am not mistaken, there is some virtualization of another server for another one of the sites, and it is very important that the server stays logged in to the administrator account or else, it will bring down the dc for the other site. and we need to switch to voip asap because the current phone system is going within the next year. money has been the main issue as to why everything is outdated. i am having to build this network practically from scratch, and on a budget. i feel like the reason everything was bandaged together was because of money, but i do not want to make the same mistakes as my predecessor. for networking gear, cisco switches are for sure out of the question. i am looking at affordable options like ubiquiti i have experience with those, and i have heard good things about barracuda. for the time being, we need to keep an onprem server because solidworks, autocad, and other engineering software that requires mapped network drives i had to switch work stations for one of the engineers and i mapped one thing wrong, and it was a cluster fck trying to see where i went wrong. documentation is okay from the msp, could be better. they also inherited a mess and have not been able to really get much done except put out small fires and just do basic help desk tickets for us. they have been discussing migrating us to o365 for as long as theyve been our msp, and its only going to happen now because i am here to oversee the project. for anybody in this sub that has had to fix such a big mess like this, how did you tackle such a huge infrastructure overhaul? i feel like i know more about implementation than thinking big picture. the o365 migration will happen soon, and after that, or actually concurrently, i have to redesign our network, and decide if i want to give that project to our msp which will charge us soooo much money, hire a contractor they may be more expensive, or cheaper, dont know, go with our isp who apparently does managed network services for businesses. any and all advice is greatly appreciated! ||  || whats the approx location, number of computers and devices and most important, the approx salary you were hired with? if youre being paid that of a support specialist but expected to do the job, and salary of a director, thats a problem. || if i were you id ask management for permission to request an rfp from the msp to bring the environment up to date. if management denies your request you know things are never going to change and you will be overworked, underpaid, and underappreciated for the duration of your employment. if management approves your request if offloads all the bad news management is going to get to the msp, instead of coming from you and the bad news may shock management into actually putting in effort and committing resources to improve the environment."
network logs analysis,"update 41525 the flapping continued but at least i knew it wasnt occurring between the vpc link i had a limited number of sfp modules to work with so i couldnt change them all however with this information i went and dug into the possibility of lacp causing the flap and i believe i discovered the event that triggers the link flap in the ethpm event history show system internal ethpm eventhistory interface ethernet 147 45 fsmethernet147 transition at 19202 usecs after sun apr 13 000944 2025 previous state triggered event next state when i checked lacp counters that link had a difference of over 10000 pdus sentrcv and when checking the interfaces themselves on catalyst1 found an enormous number of input errors logged on both members of the channelgroup. as to why these are becoming out of sync is still tbd, open to ideas update 41125 swapped out sfp and fiber cabling between nexus switches, will update on monday if anything changes. i am at my wits end trying to figure out this issue that is happening between some catalystnexus switches. roughly every 48 hours 10 minutes one of the members of a 2 interface portchannel connecting a pair of nexuscatalyst switches will flap and come back up without any error or fault being logged. this causes the entire network to go down briefly stp topo change? while the port is changing states. after the port comes back up, everything behaves normally until the next mostly predictable flaps happens. now this is where it is confusing me, the original network configuration was a series of switches connected in a ring, with two ports running lacp linking each of the switches together, so something like this nx1nx2cat1cat2cat3cat4nx1 however, i disabled the link from cat4 back to nx1 while testing as this link was the one that was initially flapping, but since those ports were disabled the link between nexus2cat1 has started the exact same behavior. logging has been unhelpful and only shows the ports going down without any insight into the cause of this, has anyone experienced anything like this or have a direction to investigate further? ive checked everything i could think of, stp, lacp, portchannel config, and nothing appears abnormal or is getting recorded. excerpts of what logs look like between the devices nexus2 2025 apr 6 000539 nexussw2 ethportchannel5fopchanged portchannel20 first

devices. it was all the time a layer1 issue. replace the sfp, change the fiber, clean the fiber plug. nobody takes care but if you have dust on the fiber plug, it can easily perturbate the signal. in addition, what are the nexus devices? n5k or n9k? if n9k, try these commands show pie interface ethernetxx transceiverinsights show pie interface ethernetxx linkflaprca show pie interface ethernetxx linkdownrca and check the transceiver detail txrx || when this suddenly started happening on one of our nexus links when we went to the rack we found a sm cable instead of a mm for that link, the tech said it worked before without issue, we then had to review all their work and explain it has to match the sfp type || looks like you forced the root bridge to be nexus 1 so should eliminate spanning tree problem. i would double check layer 2 layer 3 vpc consistency on the nexus switches as well. since its the link between the nexus and catalyst that is always being shutdown i bet it is some sort of vpc consistency parameter that is failing or one of the issues below that would bring down a vpc. thats a weird topology to me. i normally only see that type of ring topology in a large warehouse. are all those switches in the close together in the same room or at least campus are? normally i would see nexus 1 and nexus 2 with vpc link between the two, then all the catalyst switches would have a two links in a single port channel to each nexus 1 and nexus 2 switch. i would honestly just open up a ticket with cisco tac if cant fix do a google search on cisco nexus troubleshooting vpcs can run below commands in cisco nexus switch. show vpc consistencyparameters show vpc consistencyparameters interface po 10 change to match each portchannel you use vpcs in blocking state vpcs might be in the blocking state because of bridge assurance ba. vlans on a vpc moved to suspend state vlans on a vpc might move to the suspend state. symptom possible cause solution vlans on a vpc are moved to the suspend state. vlans allowed on the vpc have not been allowed on the vpc peer link. all vlans allowed on a vpc must also be allowed on the vpc peer link. also, we recommend that only vpc vlans are

network logs analysis,"hi there, were trialing out sase products with the purpose of locking down saas apps to a centralized gateway, with the intention to split tunnel any other traffic directly not through the gateway. the problem is that, even with split tunnel policies in place to route all traffic normally outoftunnel, were still experiencing delays 30 60 seconds for any event that attempts to contact the domain controller logging in, uac prompts. we also cant join or unjoin from a domain while connected to these sase clientsgateways. note that local non domain joined accounts experience no delays. am i missing something here? why is it that if were setting the traffic to not go through the client, we experience delays? turning off the clientstopping the services fixes the issue. the vendor support hasnt been helpful so far, but youd think this would be a common issue if its affecting domain accounts. note weve tried different domains, networks onprem and offprem, locations, devices, and the problem is consistent || i feel like if you are doing a trial of something and you have to come here to ask that its probably not a vendor you should use. if turning off their client fixes the issue then thats the issue. they would need to explain why. || can you share which solution youre having an issue with? it might help with determining what the issue is, e.g. name resolution, access control, inspection, etc. || im guessing windows clients, do the packets actually get routed out of the device correctly? you could also check the traffic on the gateway, do traceroutes, packet captures with wireguard, check your clients dns settings, gpos or intune configs etc. just saying dns slow is kind of unhelpful, i hope you tried getting their support to gather more info instead of just saying fix pls."
network logs analysis,"hi all, i run a small business providing it, network, and security system support. a large part of my business is taking over sites that have been neglected. often i will come across cable issues with cat6, and rs485. i am wonderimg the best way to test these cables. i am not certifying cables, just testing them to inform the client of the fault. for cable issues i would then arrange for a cable to be replaced by a contractor on the customers behalf, then test the cable again. i am hoping someone can give me advice on the best way to test a faulty cable. i think the first test might be iperf just to check the max speed of a connection. there is a fairly cheap router appliance on amazon that has 2.5gb copper nics and sfp ports for 10gb connections. one of those on either end and i should be able to get max throughput. but is that enough to identify a fault? would i be better off with an oscilloscope, and if so, which? i was looking at the owon 200 handheld series. this might also be good for testing rs485 faults? do i need both? or is there a better not too costly alternative? i dont have the budget for a fluke unfortunately. and even if i did, doesnt test rs485. iperf checking speed of both fibre and copper seems like the best value, but not sure if iperf will give me enough data, such as packet loss. i also want to be able to export logs to a spreadsheet. any advice greatly appreciated. || iperf is not going to help you identify faults anymore than a cheap continuity tester would. youre charging clients money to do a job, so do it right. either cough up the cash for a qualification tester, or bring in a subcontractor with one. a basic fluke cableiq is a bit over 2,000. || if youre subcontracting out the repair of structured cabling to a contractor, theyre going to have their own qualificationcertification equipment that can produce reports to the customer. you can get a used netally or fluke if money is short, but ideally youd want something that can export reports with linklive netally or linkware fluke. || you need something that will check the cabling ensure its wired correctly and can perform tdr and otdr functionality. that will tell you how long is this cable. how far from here is it cut or shorted. the netally units are pretty reasonably priced for these tasks and they can email you a report for each live drop you test. i wouldnt use anything less capable than one of these for this function. will also identify connected equipment, what switch and switch port you are plugged into, will negotiate poe, can also authenticate 802.1x can ping predefined hosts, check the wire map, all at the single press of a button, then automatically email that report i mentioned. i bought one for the office. it gets used rarely, but when its needed it saves a lot of time."
network logs analysis,"im working on configuring nexus 9k and could figure out the mgmt0 acl. we are using ipv6 on our oob network. the jumpbox is located on a different vlan as the network devices. the oob network is a intervlan on the core switch. i created this ipv6 acl on the nexus 9k. ipv6 accesslist mgmtacl permit tcp host fd05abcd123410100 any eq 22 log 9999 deny tcp any any log ! interface mgmt0 ipv6 trafficfilter mgmtacl in the issue is i locked myself out. the acl source is the jumpbox. i dont see any logs when i consoled into the nexus 9k. i tried to add a line 20 with a permit any any and i still could not sshin. i checked the logs from the collapsed core of the oobn and found the traffic which was source and destination are both correct, but somehow i couldnt login is there a feature that needs to be enabled to get the ipv6 acl to work? || you need to permit neighbor discovery and neighbor solicitation in the acl. permit icmp any any ndna permit icmp any any ndns"
network logs analysis,"i will try to be concise while also not tldr. bottom line up front after a lot of troubleshooting, i have figured out i have 3 switches in my network which are sending frames out for things such as arp, vtp, cdp, stp however, not receiving those protocols. topology cisco switches trunking to kg250g which is running agile vlans and using multicast mappings. for those not familiar with that nomenclature just consider im using something similar to vxlans to multicast tunnel my l2 traffic across a cloud network. my core switch and others are all seeing ingress traffic of the aforementioned protocols. these other switches are also properly sending their own traffic with no issues. native vlans match, etc. for quite a bit of troubleshooting, i assumed i had stp issues or haipe configuration irregularities but upon examining the trunk port interface to the haipe device on both sides of the topology i quickly realized the vtp joins, cdp, stp were egress only. all the above is causing quite the network headache. these sites are operating and they are receiving their multicast traffic after the site first establishes its own ping out. pings in are not arriving until first pinging out. im looking for anyone with experience with haipe device management or any of the above. could the cloud device have something misconfigured in the multicast routing such as rpf or rp? some things i will be trying tomorrow 1. swap working switch with problems and see if my problem stays with that haipe device. i think it will based on the troubleshooting so far. 2. go to the site and watch the switch power up on a console cable. 3. look at the kg logs as i now think this issue is kg related. ive probably created more questions than answers. my apologies. || "
network logs analysis,"hello everyone, im making this post because ive just spent 7 hours troubleshooting this issue and need some guidance. we have a wireless infrastructure built with extreme networks and two radius servers nps hosted on aws. everything worked fine until this morning. we have two different authentication scenarios computer authentication pcs use eaptls to authenticate with their machine certificates this works fine. user authentication for a particular ssid, we require intunemanaged devices to authenticate using their user certificates again via eaptls, just with a different policy. these devices are companyissued iphones and ipads. since this morning, this authentication method has stopped working. troubleshooting so far heres what ive checked and observed user certificates are valid. the radius server certificate was renewed 8 days ago. seems odd since issues started today, but still worth noting. windows event viewer doesnt show any logs for failed authentication auditing is enabled, but i can see entries if i enable accounting though theres no useful information there. packet capture on the server reveals some key points i see a continuous flow of radius requests and challenges but no radius responses. this could explain the lack of event viewer logs. occasionally, right after the radius request which includes the client certificate and full chain, i see an error code 49 access denied in the radius challenge sent by the nps server. according to the tls rfc, this error means accessdenied a valid certificate or psk was received, but when access control was applied, the sender decided not to proceed with negotiation. im still waiting for the packet capture from the access points i dont have access to them directly. additional notes using mschapv2 on an intunemanaged device works fine on the same ssid. questions does anyone have tips on what else i should check? could the renewed radius certificate be related even though issues started later? any insights into the error code 49 behavior? thanks in advance for any advice! edit this has been solved thanks to microsoft kb we just need to fix it before september d || this is a packet fragmentation issue. radius is udp and the size of the certificates and chain are larger than the mtu across the vpn. there is a framedmtu setting that is supposed to help with this but ive not seen it have any affect at all. the solution is to switch to a radius solution that supports radsec radius over tls. nps does not support radsec. || it sounds like it may be a certificate issue, like something is going wrong with mutual authentication or the clientserver is rejecting or missing part of the certificate chain. make sure your root certificates and or intermediary certificates werent renewed prior to renewing your radius server certificate. then check to make sure the clients and radius server have the same root and intermediary certificates in their store and validate the thumbprint of the certificates match. i have seen deployments where the radius server certificate was pushed to the client as a quick fixbandaid for when they had issues getting the devices to validate the certificate chain. if the client is storing the old certificate it may be trying to use that instead of validating the certificate the proper way. || maybe some issue with crl or ocsp on the pki setup. what does pkiview show?"
