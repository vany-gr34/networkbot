monitoring for DDoS attacks,"hey guys. i rent a dedicated server for some projects with one ipv4 ip that, due to the nature of my projects, is exposed and not behind any sort of cloudflare proxy. recently, some skript kiddie messaged me on discord that he downed my entire network. sure enough, he did. contacted my antiddos provider royalehosting and they say they cant detect anything on their end. well anyway i set up something similar to to dump pcap files to send to my provider. got hit again, then once the server came back online i downloaded the pcap files and sent them to my provider. of course, they said the provided packet captures do not seem to indicate an attack. bruh. since then ive installed netdata and spun up a cloudflare zero trust tunnel so the system can be monitored and i can just send them the url to the netdata dashboard. 1. how can ddos attacks just completely bypass an antiddos provider, and is this provider just completely trash or could they really not detect it? how do attackers mask their attacks? 2. is there anything else i can do to prove to these nincompoops that my server was indeed taken offline? for context, we had 100 packet loss, and my ssh connections were blocked for hours. all web deployments were unreachable as well. 3. should i drop these guys for their incompetence? 4. since the botnet was chinese, is there anyway to just deny all traffic from china entirely, like with iptables? or is that a pointless operation? i am no expert in networking, just a humble selftaught sysadmin running my own projects. thanks for any insights you guys can provide. || cloud flare proxy wont stop a ddos attack towards an ip if the attacker knows the real public ip. cloud flare hosts your dns, provides a new public ip to hide the true public ip behind and force all traffic destined to the fqdn through its system. but if they arent attacking the fqdn, the traffic wont go through cloudflare. ask your isp to change your public ip, make sure there is nothing announcing dns for the new ip. setup cloudflare dns so that the cloudflare proxy forwards traffic to the new ip. || are you showing an increase in network traffic during the outages? if yes, probable ddos. if no, probably something cleverermake sure your system and all software are up to date. there are databases of ip address geolocation maxmind is a well known one, where you can create a rule to deny all traffic from addresses listed as being in china hong kong, etc.. results vary. || "
monitoring for DDoS attacks,"hey there, i rent a dedicated server that uses nsfocuscorero inline ddos protection. am i wasting my money paying extra for this? my questions are whats so special about inline protection that costs an extra 70 a month? can it actually filter all attacks like it claims? || whats the cost per hour for whatever service you are hosting being down? || please look up the difference between dos and ddos attacks. the only thing that can save you from a ddos is someone in line in front of you with more bandwidth than the attacker. edit also if you are not concerned that a ddos might happen maybe you dont need that protection."
monitoring for DDoS attacks,"hello, my game mmorpg will be launching in a couple of months and i want to take appropriate steps to shield us from ddos attacks. after discussing this with various people i have come to the conclusion that the following architecture would be the best option 1. separate login server from game server 2. once authenticated on login server, white list ip on the game server 3. reconnect to the game server with an auth code obtained from the login server 4. by default block any nonwhitelisted ip on the game server an issue with this is that most hosting companies do not offer an api to whitelist ips on demand on the edge firewall before it hits our network card. this makes the game server still vulnerable to volumetric attacks which is a problem for us because even 1 minute of downtime happening sporadically would kill us, which is not that expensive to do for attackers. my question is if anyone has experience setting up this kind of architecture and if so has recommendation for a hosting company that allows this kind of configuration. || use ddos mitigation services cloudflare, akamai etc || edge architecture will matter and i know nothing about your environment. i will say most of the major csps have the apis you are looking for and can auto scale your infrastructure. you can also use bare metal in those environments as well. you will need a ddos solution and they are not cheap. also latency and how clean packets are returned is very important. in many cases gre tunnels are used which can affect latency. spread the edge customer facing servers as much as you can and protect them with ddos in close proximity. do not buy ddos hard for on prem scrubbing you will have to do it in the cloud. find a solid hosting company to work with you and also you will probably need a 24 ipv4 addresses per site to get be able to send the traffic to the scrubbing engine. || you need traffic to be routed through a layer in front of the game server which responds quickly to acl updates. you could simply rent highthroughput servers loadbalanced to passthrough traffic with minimal processing except for acl checking etc. or perhaps you can utilise existing cloud provided http api services which can authenticate clients and provide rate limiting. the login server could provide an auth token to the client which then gets added to traffic so that the http api service lets the traffic through. rate limit pertoken traffic in case a token gets compromised."
monitoring for DDoS attacks,"my title is network security admin, and i make a 55k salary in an hcol area. a typical day is as follows we have firewalls and other devices installed at about 300 client sites that i monitor in the ubiquiti dashboard if a site goes down, i first call the isp we have set up for that location and see if a simple reboot will fix the problem. if they cant see any equipment, ill have them dispatch one of their techs. otherwise, ill make a ticket for myself, then dispatch to the site and try to fix the problem. usually, its a layer 1 problem or a configuration issue that one of the less experienced techs caused, but sometimes it can be layer 3 or 4. occasionally, we have firewalls with consistent issues, and i need to read logs to determine whats going on. when i joined this company, they didnt have their firewalls configured correctly. by default, they were allowing all traffic through. so, i created a syslog server and pointed all our firewalls to it. my syslog server identified hundreds of thousands of ssh attacks daily which explains why our sites were constantly going down, so i updated the configurations and pushed them to all of our sites with an ansible script. we also had an incident a year ago where a client needed us to download footage from a specific period, but we couldnt because the nvr had gone down, and we didnt even know. so, now im in the process of trying to create a solution that will notify us when a port goes down. sometimes, on my dispatches, ill engage with clients and try to identify opportunities for network upgrades. ill do a site survey and then provide them with a quote. for example, i went to fix this property managment companys wifi from an old it company, and i guess i impressed the lady running things enough to convince her to upgrade their wlan with our equipment. i did a site survey with her, explaining how we could implement it and how much it would cost. we then sent her a proposal the next day, and she signed it. i came back to install everything. ive only been in the industry for about 1.5 years, but sometimes i feel like i wear a lot of hats, and i dont know if im being adequately compensated. || youre seriously, significantly underpaid. however, this is a very rough time to be looking for a new job, so tread carefully. || immediately no. || read the first sentence. no, you are not getting paid enough."
monitoring for DDoS attacks,"we had a terrible weekend with our vpn platform this weekend which you would call some sort of sprayattack or ddos attack of some sort. the asa is updated since way back for the vulnerabilites as and my question to the community is when analyzing the logs we could see several attemtps on accessing thru serial to console, we are sure we didnt have any intrusion from the inside of the dc. anyone seen this attempts to intrusion on serial? see || my team tried to work with cisco addressing vulnerabilities in the ngfw asa firepower platforms. cisco was flippant at best. took a year to document security vulnerabilities as cves and 6 months to provide work around, and 9 months to apply fix. we dropped the cisco security platforms and have implemented the palo alto platform and what a tremendous improvement! || i guess you use a cisco routerfirewall for your vpn service? which is also manageable remotely? is there a device connected to the serial port? did you configure a loopback interface? || regardless of the latest fixes you mentioned, isnt 9.13 already eovss?"
monitoring for DDoS attacks,"i am planning to offer ddos protection for my companys vps hosting clients. i have two ip transit providers one has ddos protection and the other one doesnt. can i use in some way a single 24 prefix with both ip transit providers announce the network through bgp in a secure way? the goal is to enable ddos protection for specific ips while blackhole the rest in case of an attack this is something that the ip transit provider providing the ddos protection supports, but i dont know if i can make this work reliably if i use both ip transit providers to announce the same 24 prefix. i apologize in advance if this is a stupid question, but i dont have much experience with bgp. || if you stop announcing the prefix to the nonscrubbing transit, things will work as you and your clients would expect. otherwise youll get some non trivial amount of traffic unfiltered. look up how the bgp route decision engine works || arelions ddos can automatically announce a more specific prefix which will pull in the ingress traffic during the attack."
monitoring for DDoS attacks,"although the primary way we remediate sqli and xss vulnerabilities is in code, i would like a back up option that can block these two attack methods in case theres ever a vulnerability in our code. code is always the 1 place where you block vulnerabilities, but everyone makes mistakes including developers and youre opening the door to trouble if you dont have a compensating control. i have a few ideas two leading ideas for compensating controls that could handle xss, nosqli, and other attack methods all in one place. the first option that comes to mind is using a traditional waf, namely mod security or coraza ive got an ennvironment with an nginx ingress that i dont want to replace with caddy, and coraza only offers experimental support for nginx. this works, but can get pretty expensive and involves the hastle of managing and monitoring a vm whose sole prupose is to support the waf. the waf and cf wafs are way to expensive for my pruposes would run up 12k a year according to reps... yikes, so im not even gonna think about those. the second option would be enabling contentsecuritypolicy csp headers and http strict transport security hsts on my nginx ingress pods in k8s. this looks like a much simpler way to block xssnosqli, but id like to know if it provides he same kind of protection id get out of corazamod security. please let me know if csp headers and hsts will be adequate for blocking nosqlixss, or if i should invest in a corazamod security waf. thanks || "
monitoring for DDoS attacks,"the environment in question is a company with 4 sites, 2 clouds one for their clients, one internal and lots of remote workers. to increase security we decided to implement network segmentation. i just read a lot of posts regarding how to access the management vlan and i think a jump host within the managementvlan with standalone user management and excessive monitoring will be the best compromise between security and usability. but im still not sure whats the best way to connect to this host. we have fortigates on all sites and can configure policies for accessing this jumphost down on a aduserlevel or better member of a specific adusergroup. but isnt rdp too obvious to attackers? should it be some kind of remote access tool like lets say teamviewer, restricted to accept connection only from specific subnets would this be even possible with teamviewer? does anyone know an affordable solution for this? thanks for any idea || ssh is my preferred method of accessing a jumphost. using certs rather than passwords for auth, and locked down on the firewall to only allow connections from your management hosts. || seeing as you run fortigate, i would say that restricting access down to the user level is likely sufficient. trying to obscure the method of access is, in my opinion, effort misplaced. user level access, accompanied with strong authentication methods, should suffice. if any potential attacker is getting past that, i dont think that obscuring access to systems via a jump host will be sufficient. || if you are going to use a jump host try to implement 2fa. with duo you can secure the rdp or ssh connection."
monitoring for DDoS attacks,"im looking into web app firewalls that are self hosted because of the flaws of the cloud ones like aws waf etc, and because the others require a lot of money to pay for up front, but i have access to things like haproxy enterprise and varnish enterprise etc. so im curious which waf you think is likely the most performant and best overall when it comes to protecting an api here are some things i want to stop 1. bots 2. scraping 3. ddos, dos, dow i cant have false positives, or at a minimum, i need as few as humanly possible. i also refuse to use captchas because they arent effective and they hurt the user experience. security by obscurity is also still somewhat relevant. id rather handle excess traffic and stress the server than have a false positive. i plan on reading some books to catch up on some of the latest techniques being used to attack sites, because theres a lot of extra stuff that needs to be handled. so far, i think haproxy seems like the most straightforward to accomplish this. im not worried about the waf protecting the application since im making it myself and can fix any possible sql injection etc. similar attacks at the level of the application, i primarily want the waf to stop someone from taking down the site, racking up my charges or scraping the content. imo akamai has a horrible waf, because if someone on a network requests something like .htaccess a couple of times, it will block the site on the entire network, which quite literally defeats the entire point of preventing dosddos attacks. and i certainly cant have that. not that i could afford akamai, but i thought id throw that out there. options 1. haproxy enterprise waf 2. varnish enterprise waf 3. nginx app protect 4. apache modsecurity 5. nginx modsecurity 6. openresty otherwise, do you know of any paygo firewalls that are robust? my biggest worry is a denial of wallet attack, which i cannot afford, so that makes the majority of these options unviable, but of course i could put something like edgio with ratelimits or something in front of a self hosted waf or something. so far, i am most familiar with aws waf azure waf stackpath defunct azure waf edgio waf sucuri and some others idk. ive messed with barracuda, fortinet and others, but theyre complicated to setup, expensive and use stuff like regex etc. like any other firewall. im thinking haproxy alone might be the best, but i dont necessarily have a way to benchmark it right now. i also want to self host in oracle cloud, which offers very generous network throughput and seems to have really high resiliency against ddos. worst case scenario, i build my own antiddos with something like ebpf xdp, freebsds netmap, or dpdk. waf, thats another story. additionally, i plan on delivering static assets from apache traffic server, but im torn whether or not i should put a proxy with antiddos capabilities in front of it or find another solution, because i dont want to hurt the performance of ats || regarding number 3 it is not possible because the attacker has a bigger pipe than you do, you need to get some kind of ddos protection on the network levelbgp. || i think you are asking for a bit much. besides the one touch ones cloudflare is first that comes to mind you will need to do tuning. so saying its too much money and cant use regex seems a little too optimistic. wafs are complicated, so cheap easy secure, pick 2. || please add to the list skudonet waf. ready to go"
monitoring for DDoS attacks,"i am a final year bese studentcgpa 3.9 and started off with web development, worked a bit in it, and then in my 3rd year i got to do some networking courses, upon the completion of which, piqued my interest. i also developed a research paper and sdn project on ddos attack mitigation using machine learning neural networks. so my mind has been quite steered towards pursuing networking related masters programmes now. now i know that networking is a very deep subset of other fields, and certifications are more important and valued in it, but there are two reasons for me doing masters. firstly because of my interest as i described earlier. secondly, i honestly want to go out of this country because man, things are getting awful here in the job market. with that being said, i asked a professor in my department, who has a phd in networking, about where to start searching and what to work on in networking, and he said to search in sdn and ibn intent based networking and search any aspect in that to describe in my statement of purpose. my questions are that how should i search for any aspect to research in after i enroll in the programme, as i would have to describe it in my sop. i tried to search in the sdn and ibn fields but i wasnt able to get accurate results maybe i researched wrong, guidance would be appreciated in this case. secondly, how can i back up my motivation, like should i do projects or research. the research paper i wrote in the ddos mitigation project i described earlier is confirmed for publishment by my professor, so maybe thats a plus for me? for projects i cant seem to find what should i strive to build, should i go for projects like dms lookup, or tcpip stack, or should i do some unique usecases in sdn some ideas would be appreciated plz. i dont quite understand ibn yet so not sure about that. i apologize for the long post but i had to give the context. any advice would be highly appreciated. ill try and reply as soon as i can. thanks a bunch || you seems to like the software part of networking. that is software, obviously, and lots of math graph, discrete, calculus, etc.. cs is right up that alley. i would look at the fundamentals and see what you want to dive deep into. sde job postings for vendorsfaang in the network org can give some insight as well. software examples of protocols can be found in sonic and frr. hardware is another beast as is pretty much the inverse of software massive parallelism, throw data away and recompute. that would be ee. look up some rfc drafts to see what people are proposing and what the needs are moving towards."
