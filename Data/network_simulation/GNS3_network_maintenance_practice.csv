GNS3 network maintenance practice,"i searched in this sub for the past couple of hours for past posts about network performance and resources to become better at creating performant networks or troubleshooting performance related issues. personally, i feel like i have a good handle on network availability and security in terms of design, implementation, and maintenance. however, i cannot say the same about performance. so does any one have good recommendations in the realm of network performance? i am looking to level up in that area but i dont know where to start. || make sure your mtu sizes are good. anything beyond that is probably not a network issue. || look for the section network performance related resources at the bottom of learn about bdp and nagle algorithm good luck."
GNS3 network maintenance practice,"i have been working on this lab in ine for the ccnp encore and i can get everything to work no problem but one thing struck me that i dont quiet understand. this is the image of the topology when we redistribute the eigrp 100 routes in bgp and the routes are installed into r3s rib i can reach the next hop for r2 which is the router that redistributes the eigrp routes into bgp but i cannot reach the destination of the route install. for example one of the routes redistributed is in the trace route i can reach the r2 router but fails after i could not understand why that is the case. i thought once r3 reaches the next hope r2 would know how to send that traffic to r1s loopback considering it has a route to reach it in its rib. this is the lab in question if anyone uses ine || maybe you have forgotten to redistribute bgp into eigrp 100. || when r2 is redistributing the eigrp routes into bgp, it will advertise it to r3 unless if you have a routemap that prevents it to be advertised. do you have a routemap? the route for 140.0.1.1 must be presented in r3 routing table, otherwise, r3 will have no idea how to reach it. it is not enough for only r2 to know how to reach 140.0.1.1. can you show the output of r3 routing table? do a show ip bgp 140.0.1.0"
GNS3 network maintenance practice,"ive got a small enterprise network i am deploying.. a pair of c9336cfx2e running nxos 10.35 in vpc domain. since this is for the enterprise not an msp, i really see no advantage to running multiple vrfs, my preference is to keep things simple... although i have gone wthe best practice of keeping the vpc peerkeepalive on the management vrf by itself. what i really want to talk about is all of these mentions of having dedicated layer2 and dedicated layer3 links. i much prefer to have a nice fat 400gig vpc peer link on which i have the peergateway, layer3 peerrouter, fastconvergence, and autorecovery features enabled. the use case is for hpc and vdi all deployed into a single cabinet with a pure storage with file services... were looking at omnissa for vdi. but getting back to having dedicated layer3 which is often cited as a best practice the only advantages i see are to prevent routing issues during potential misconfigurations, and potentially faster recovery in certain failure scenarios.. ignoring misconfigurations lets assume they wont happen changes will be very minimal once this is up and running what am i missing, why is it a bp to add dedicated layer3 links? i am going to be running ospf in the network core on the same switches that host the vpc domain... why cant i just let that all run over the same vpc peerlink? please tell me what im missing here... not to mention if you look at the table on this link there are asterisks and other symbols next to l2 link and l3 link for different topological routing adjacencies ie. future support may be limited with dedicated l2l3 links if the environment expands || love this, youre clearly thinking this through. im a var and heres kinda what ive seen from customers and cisco ses in similar vpc builds dedicated layer 3 links give you fault isolation. if your vpc peerlink gets congested, flaps, or hits errors, you dont want routing protocols or northsouth traffic tied up in that. vpc peerlinks are really meant for eastwest l2 traffic and vpc control plane sync. when you push routing adjacencies and l3 over them, especially with ospf, recovery behavior can get messy under failure conditions. ciscos own best practice is to keep the vpc peerlink clean, and use a separate routed link often via the same pair of switches, sure for l3 adjacencies like ospf or bgp. helps avoid weird dependencies during convergence events. your setup with 400g and all the vpc enhancements sounds solid. if your use case is predictable and failure domains are small, it may still work fine. but if you anticipate growth or changes vdi scaleout, separation is worth it. dm me if you need more helpsupport! || we just use a virtual l3 link using svis 30. you want l3 connectivity between the n9ks right? || maybe it was before being able to use layer3 peerrouter? im on a big peerlink vpc like your config and its fine with vpc, ospf, bgp, multicast and without peerrouter it wouldnt be possible or half the traffic would just black hole."
GNS3 network maintenance practice,"im sure this has been asked to death but i recently got a new backpack for work, one of the vendors my company partners with was giving them away as a gift meant for people on the network team. i had hoped that his backpack would come with inserts inside for network cables or something, but there doesnt appear to be anything in it. im pretty tired of having a mess of wires and devices all over my backpack especially because they vary in size so much whenever i actually need to grab something its kind of a nightmare. ive seen inserts online and ill probably buy one off amazon. but i was curious if anybody knows any other options. it seems like a lot of the inserts i seen online either are too small like for travel use during vacation, or too big practically like a briefcase, or the elastics for the wires to be rolled up into arent big enough to support any wires bigger than a small patch cable or something. || i swear by retractable cables. you can get them in all flavors, hdmi, usb, cat7 even. ive got two mesh pouches in my pack, one for nonnetwork retractables and another for networkonly. need a really long network cable? throw a coupler in there and make 2 cables into one. || ziplock bags. cheap, waterproof, available in many sizes and if i break one, nbd i have 50 more in a box at home. || i use travel packing pouches. every cable gets individual velcro and is then organized into either network, serial or power. for me this balances out the need for organization without going overboard."
GNS3 network maintenance practice,"hello fellow network admins, how did you become a good network admin? i tend to struggle in my role at times, ive been in networking for about a year and at my current position for about 6 months and i struggle with complex network issues. i can troubleshoot and take care of minor networking tasks like programming ports, creating small config changes, and managing our aps, but there are times when things are just not working, and ill sit there for 12 hours just staring at a config going over it multiple times just to be stumped and not find anything. i usually google things but there are times i cant seem to find a good resolution to my problem which leads me to ask the lead network admin just for them to solve the issue in a few minutes. i feel there is a huge gap in knowledge due to them building the network and me going into an exisiting network that is pretty large and critical. do i suck? do my research skills suck? do i need more time? do i need to study more and read about networking more than i already have? i lack in the implementation i understand how a lot of things in networking well work but its when the time comes to put that into practice that i choke and dont seem to know anything. any advice helps || you need more time and to use your log file. running config for examples. build a command list from troubleshooting. experience is gained over time exploring these headaches. takes years to do things in minutes. rock out with your cli out mate || 6 months is not a long time at all. it seems like you have a desire to get better and want to learn. just keep that up and give it some more time and you will get there eventually. theres always going to be someone who knows more than you so dont let that discourage you. || when the lead admin fixes them. do you follow up with them? what was the issue? how did you fix it?"
GNS3 network maintenance practice,"i have been searching to try and find an answer but i keep coming up blank. so any thoughts will be appreciated. i have asked both dell software support and dell networking but neither of them has an answer. the networking group does not have any best practice for how to setup the switch for use with hyperv to best take advantage of vlt networking. i have dell pro support plus on all my equipment. the dell network team says it is a hyperv question on how they want it setup. the dell software support says this is a dell networking question and they both think they are independent. i am running hyperv and using powershell to create a virtual set using hypervport for load balancing. i have a 3 node cluster running 75 virtual servers on the cluster set does not support lacp my hyperv host are connected to two dell switches that are running dell os10 setup with vlt all servers are the same the following is an example of one server 1 connected to switch 1 with 2 ports connected to switch 2 with 2 ports all 4 ports on server 1 are in a single set virtual switch i have added host os, cluster network and backup network as virtual nics off the main set so the os sees the host os, cluster network and backup network iscsi is on dedicated nics that are not part of set and are using mpio with a nic connected to each switch. to best handle efficient routing of traffic between virtual servers and fast notification of down link events what is the preferred method of setup from the switch side of the equation. i run 10 rds session host servers using fslogix for profile storage so network latency matters to give my users a good experience. option 1 do nothing on the ports at the switch level. this requires that all traffic be routed and can put a lot of traffic on the backplane of the vlti interface between the switches because it does not optimize traffic. option 2 setup a port channel with lacp set to static. this will communicate to the vlt switches the group of ports are together for routing and notification and not creating loops. my understanding is this also helps with routing of traffic and notification during loss of 1 switch i.e. maintenance windows for switch. option 3 doing an lbfo nic team that does support lacp then apply the set switch to the team was an option but is not the recommended method from microsoft. also this only gives you one vmmq because the set only sees one nic so it cannot take advantaged of all 4 nics for offloading traffic. option 4 some other method best load balancing for vlt switches vnic is the guest nic and pnic is the physical nic currently all my virtual servers have 1 vnic best practice from microsoft is to use hypervport for all 10gb or faster nics. option 1 hypervport this basically sets a vm to a card the distribution is done by the os and just load them up in a round robin fashion. this vnic1 connects to pnic1 vnic2 connects to pnic2 vnic3 connects to pnic3 vnic4 connects to pnic4 vnic5 connects to pnic1 etc. option 2 dynamic the traffic from vnics gets send out on all 4 pnics in round robin but only one pnic can receive traffic. i do not know if it the process is smart enough to know that it is talking with a vm guest that also on the same switch then it would only send out on the pnics that are connected with that same switch. this could generate a lot of traffic on the vlti backplane if half of the packets are coming from the other switch. i must be over thinking this which is not unusual for me but the lack of documentation is pretty astounding considering this technology has been around for 10 years. || vlt seems to be the dell version of vpc. dont do anything on the switches, set is switch independent and works fine as is. || yep. no fancy config on switches. how load is balanced and bandwidth utilized depends on if the port is set to dynamic or hyper v. you should probably use hyperv port for your vms. refer to the guide from lenovo below which details set requirements and setup for hyperconverged. it is the same for converged, but includes rdma setup. microsoft also has documentation on this on learn.microsoft.com. || yes you dont really do any lag or anything. just present the ports and set itself will handle it."
GNS3 network maintenance practice,"i am fairly new to networking, i want to make a network architecture with next gen firewall and internal firewall as i want to get more understanding on them, so how do i install these firewalls on my gns3 || you can look into getting a fortigate virtual appliance into gns3. that should work || you can get a free trial for vsrx from juniper. || i integrate it with vmware and use the vendors vm or virtual appliance."
GNS3 network maintenance practice,"as the title says. i was hired at a manufacturing company as an it support specialist very recently, and 2 weeks in i have realized i am actually the it director and the entire it departmentwe do have an msp. i was very clearly told to not answer tickets because i am not help desk, and i have more important things to do. i inherited a mess of a network, and i have to build everything from scratch. the msp charges so much money to help us on our projects, of which there are many because, again, the network is a mess. to start, the network is on nothing but unmanaged switches whose warranties have expired at least 6 years ago, and i am being generous when i say that. we have 3 waps on the first floor, but there is no vlan, so of course wifi is on the same subnet. the switch that is connected to those 3 waps is a small netgear switch with 45 ports, and one port is completely out. we pay for fiber internet, but of course, with the switches being so outdated, we are not even using a third of that speed that is being paid for! because it is a manufacturing company everything is onprem, and the main server is not only a dcaddns. it is also the print server, the license server for the software used by engineers, the file server, the back up for one of the financial software used by the accounting department. if i am not mistaken, there is some virtualization of another server for another one of the sites, and it is very important that the server stays logged in to the administrator account or else, it will bring down the dc for the other site. and we need to switch to voip asap because the current phone system is going within the next year. money has been the main issue as to why everything is outdated. i am having to build this network practically from scratch, and on a budget. i feel like the reason everything was bandaged together was because of money, but i do not want to make the same mistakes as my predecessor. for networking gear, cisco switches are for sure out of the question. i am looking at affordable options like ubiquiti i have experience with those, and i have heard good things about barracuda. for the time being, we need to keep an onprem server because solidworks, autocad, and other engineering software that requires mapped network drives i had to switch work stations for one of the engineers and i mapped one thing wrong, and it was a cluster fck trying to see where i went wrong. documentation is okay from the msp, could be better. they also inherited a mess and have not been able to really get much done except put out small fires and just do basic help desk tickets for us. they have been discussing migrating us to o365 for as long as theyve been our msp, and its only going to happen now because i am here to oversee the project. for anybody in this sub that has had to fix such a big mess like this, how did you tackle such a huge infrastructure overhaul? i feel like i know more about implementation than thinking big picture. the o365 migration will happen soon, and after that, or actually concurrently, i have to redesign our network, and decide if i want to give that project to our msp which will charge us soooo much money, hire a contractor they may be more expensive, or cheaper, dont know, go with our isp who apparently does managed network services for businesses. any and all advice is greatly appreciated! ||  || whats the approx location, number of computers and devices and most important, the approx salary you were hired with? if youre being paid that of a support specialist but expected to do the job, and salary of a director, thats a problem. || if i were you id ask management for permission to request an rfp from the msp to bring the environment up to date. if management denies your request you know things are never going to change and you will be overworked, underpaid, and underappreciated for the duration of your employment. if management approves your request if offloads all the bad news management is going to get to the msp, instead of coming from you and the bad news may shock management into actually putting in effort and committing resources to improve the environment."

GNS3 network maintenance practice,"hoping to get everyones input. what do you believe is the best practice for printer ips static dhcp reservation or manually configured static ip on device? poll background at a place where the old adage if it aint broke, dont change lives strong. this includes essentially all 100 printers being set with manually configured static ips on the device only, no dhcp record. the reasoning is if dhcp goes down, it still works. ive been in it for 20 years, and and i cant recall a time when that happened, plus if dhcp goes down, theres something a lot bigger wrong. we have an ipdhcp management site for our network as were part of a much larger corporation that uses it, and i want to make the push to get our location using that and static dhcp reservations instead. can you guys help me out? i need ammo for switching over. || dhcp reservation is best beacause you can make changes from a centralized spot and makes troubleshooting easier. ive never seen dhcp go down either. || imo dhcp. if necessary one can give it a static assignment with a long lease time to bridge over any dhcp outage other than the device rebooting. || dhcp as you will never need a tech physically onsite to do anything other than plug the device into the wall"
