Guidelines for Network Deployment Principles The GSM Association recognises that there is public concern about the aesthetics of siting and allegations of possible health effects of radio base stations. This public concern is in contrast to a number of independent expert reviews that have concluded that there is no convincing scientific evidence of a link between public e xposure to low level radio signals generated by mobile telecommunications systems and adverse human health effects. The wireless industry acknowledges that there is a responsibility on it, with central and local government, to address community concerns about radio base stations. Background to the Guidelines The main elements of these guidelines incl ude clear information exchange with local authorities and other key stakeholders, proactive operator site sharing initiatives when feasible, environmental sensitivity considerations, and more efficient and detailed availability of data. The key health and safety aspects include operator provision of declarations of network infrastr ucture compliance with relevant national or international guidelines. These guidelines are consistent with voluntary commitments made by GSM Association members in Australia, the UK, other countries and with the GSM Europe (GSME) 'best practice' recommendation on network rollout adopted in late 2001. The GSM Association Guidelines  The GSM Association and its Members wel come continuing independent, high quality and objective research and are cu rrently supporting research recommended by the World Health Organisation to a ddress scientific uncertainties. On-going research will ensure that policy can be based on substantiated scientific evidence and will provide the basis for on-going review of exposure guidelines.

The GSM Association opposes the imposition of local unscientific restrictio ns on siting that discriminate against mobile communications.  GSM Association members should consider the appropriate form for a declaration of compliance with radiofrequency exposure guidelines. This would support openness and improve the confidence of local communities in the compliant operation of base stations.  The GSM Association believes that the provision of technological information to regulatory and planning authorities is an effective means of raising awareness and understanding of the deployment issues confronting Members.  Improved dialogue with local authorities and other key regulatory stakeholders will increase understanding of network in frastructure development requirements and the impacts of local planning frameworks. The consultation process should take into account planning, environmental and community issues.  GSM Association Members should consider whether communication with regulatory and planning authorities could be improved through the use of clear and consistent supporting documentation.  Site sharing with other radio installations or existing structures, where technically feasible and in line with competition law and licensing conditions, should be factored into decisions on the most envi ronmentally appropriate radio base station solution.  Appropriate siting and design that reduce s the visual profile of antennas can help allay public concerns. The GSM Association recognises that, where reasonable and practical, measures can be taken to minimise the environmental impact of radio base station developments.  The GSM Association supports clear processes to respond to enquiries about radio base stations and that the information provid ed to the public needs to be of a high standard.
