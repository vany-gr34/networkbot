 12 / 66 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) HOST Interface 2 W5500 provides SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Bus Interface with 4 signals (SCSn, SCLK, MOSI, MISO) for external HOST interface, and operate s as a SPI Slave. The W5500 SPI can be connected to MCU as shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 according to its operation mode (Variable Length Data / Fixed Length Data Mode) which will be explained in .3 and .4. In Figure 4, SPI Bus can be shared with other SPI Devices. Since the SPI Bus is dedicated to W5500, SPI Bus cannot be shared with other SPI Devices. It is shown in Figure 5. At the Variable Length Data mode (as shown in Figure 4), it is possible to share the SPI Bus with other SPI devices. However, at the Fixed Length Data mode (as shown in Figure 5), the SPI Bus is dedicated to W5500 and can ’t be shared with other devices. Figure 4. Variable Length Data Mode (SCSn controlled by the host) Figure 5. Fixed Length Data Mode (SCSn is always connected by Ground) The SPI protocol defines four modes for its operation (Mode 0, 1, 2, 3).Each mode differs according to the SCLK polarit y and phase. The only difference between SPI Mode 0 and SPI Mode 3 is the polarity of the SCLK signal at the inactive state. With SPI Mode 0 and 3, data is always latched in on the rising edge of SCLK and always output on the falling edge of SCLK.

 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) 13 / 66 The W5 500 supports SPI Mode 0 and Mode 3. Both MOSI and MISO signals use transfer sequence from Most Significant Bit (MSB) to Least Significant Bit (LSB) when MOSI signal transmits and MISO signal receives. MOSI & MISO signals always transmit or receive in sequen ce from the Most Significant Bit (MSB) to Least Significant Bit (LSB). Figure 6. SPI Mode 0 & 3 2.1 SPI Operation Mode W5500 is controlled by SPI Frame (Refer to the .2 SPI Frame) which communicates with the External Host. W5500 SPI Frame consists 3 phases, Address Phase, Control Phase and Data Phase. Address Phase specifies 16 bits Offset Address for W5500 Register or TX/RX Memory. Control Phase specifies the block to which Offset (set by Address Phase) belongs, and specifies Read/Write Access Mode and SPI Operation Mode (Variable Length Data / Fixed Length Data Mode). And Data Phase specifies random length (N -bytes, 1 ≤ N) Data or 1 byte, 2 bytes and 4 bytes Data. If SPI Operation Mode is set as Variable Length Data Mode (VDM), SPI Bus Signal SCSn must be controlled by the External Host with SPI Frame step. At the Variable Len gth Data Mode, SCSn Control Start (Assert (High -to-Low)) informs W5500 of SPI Frame Start (Addres s Phase), and SCSn Control End (De -assert (Low -toHigh) informs W5500 of SPI Frame End (Data Phase End of random N byte).

 14 / 66 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) 2.2 SPI Frame W5500 SPI Frame consists of 16bits Offset Address in Address Phase, 8bits Control Phase and N bytes Data Phase as shown in Figure 7. The 8bits Control Phase is reconfigured with Block Select bits (BSB[4:0]), Read/Write Access Mode bit (RWB) and SPI Operation Mode (OM[1:0]). Block Select bits select the block to which the Offset Address belongs. Figure 7. SPI Frame Format W5500 supports Sequential Data Read/Write. It processes the data from the base (the Offset Address which is set for 2/4/N byte Sequential data processing) and the next data by increasing the Offset Address (auto increment addressing) by 1. 2.2.1 Address Phase This A ddress Phase specifies the 16 bits Offset Address for the W5500 Registers and TX/RX Buffer Blocks. The 16-bit Offset Address value is transferred from MSB to LSB sequentially. The SPI frame with 2/4/N byte data phase supports the Sequential Data Read/Write in which Offset address automatically increases by 1 every 1 byte data. 16btis Offset Address0 1 2 3 Data 1Bit15 765432107654321076543210 Control ByteN+2 Data N76543210. . .Address Phase Control PhaseData Phase N >= 1 MSB first MSB first 141312111098 Block Select BitsOP ModeR W

SPI Operation Mode supports two modes, the Variable Length Data Mode and the Fixed Length Data Mode. - Variable Length Data Mode (VDM): Data Length is controlled by SCSn. External Host makes SCSn Signal Assert (High -to-Low) and informs the start of the SPI Frame Address Phase to W5500. Then the external host transfers the Control Phase with OM[1:0]=’00’. After N -Bytes Data Phase transfers, SCSn Signal is De -asserted (Low-to-High) and informs the end of the SPI Frame Data Phase to W5500. In VDM Mode, the SCSn must be controlled with SPI Frame unit by the External Host. (Refer to the Figure 4) 
 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) 17 / 66 - Fixed Length Data Mode ( FDM): In FDM, the Data Length is set by OM[1:0], these are not ‘00’ value. So, the SCSn signal should be Low state, and has one Length type (among 1 Bytes, 2 Bytes, 4 Bytes) according to the OM[1:0] value. (Refer to the Figure 5.) The next table shows the SPI Operation Mode according to the OM[1:0]. OM[1:0] Meaning 00 Variable Data Length Mode, N -Bytes Data Phase (1 ≤ N) 01 Fixed Data Length Mode, 1 Byte Data Length (N = 1) 10 Fixed Data Length Mode, 2 Byte Data Length (N = 2) 11 Fixed Data Length Mode, 4 Byte Data Length (N = 4) 2.2.3 Data Phase With the Control Phase set by the SPI Operation Mode Bits OM[1:0], the Data Phase is set by two types of length, one type is the N -Bytes length (VDM mode) and the other type is 1/2/4 Bytes (FDM mode). At this time, 1 byte data is transferred through MOSI or MISO signal from MSB to LSB sequentially. 2.3 Variable Length Data Mode (VDM) In VDM mode, the SPI Frame Data Phase Length is determined by SCSn Control of the External Host. That means that the Data Phase Length can have random value (Any length from 1 Byte to N Bytes) according to the SCSn Control. The OM[1:0] of the Control Phase should be ‘00’ value in VDM mode.

In VDM mode, the RWB signal is ‘1’ (Write), OM[1:0] is ‘00’ in SPI Frame Control Phase. At this time the External Host assert (High -to-Low) SCSn signal before transmitting SPI Frame. Then the Host transmits SPI Frame ’s all bits to W5500 through MOSI signal. All bits are synchronized with the falling edge of the SCLK. After finishing the SPI Frame transmit, the Host deasserts SCSn signal (Low -toHigh). When SCSn is Low and the Data Phase continues, the Sequential Data Write can be supported.

 24 / 66 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) 2.4 Fixed Length Data Mode (FDM) The FDM mode can be used when the External Host cannot control SCSn signal. The SCSn signal should be tied to Low (Always connected to GND) and it is not possible to share the SPI Bus with other SPI Devices. (Refer to the Figure 5.) In VDM mode, Data Phase length is controlled by SCSn control. But in FDM mode, Data Phase length i s controlled by OM[1:0] value ( ‘01’ / ‘10’ / ‘11’) which is the SPI Operation Mode Bits of the Control Phase. As the SPI Frame of FDM mode is the same as SPI Frame of VDM mode (1Byte, 2 Bytes, 4 Bytes SPI Frame) except for the SCSn signal control and OM[1:0] setting, the detail about FDM mode is not described in this section. It is not recommended to use the FDM mode unless you are in inevitable status. In addition, we use only 1/2/4 Bytes SPI Frame, as described in ‘.4.1 ’ & ‘.4.2 ’. Using SPI Frame with other length of Data will cause malfunction of W5500.

 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) 27 / 66 Register and Memory Organization 3 W5500 has one Common Register Block, eight Socket Register Blocks, and TX/RX Buffer Blocks allocated to each Socket. Each block is selected by the BSB[4:0](Block Select Bit) of SPI Frame. Figure 20 shows the selected block by the BSB[4:0] and the available offset addre ss range of Socket TX/RX Buffer Blocks. Each Socket ’s TX Buffer Block exists in one 16KB TX memory physically and is initially allocated with 2KB. Also, Each Socket ’s RX Buffer Block exists in one 16KB RX Memory physically and is initially allocated with 2KB. Regardless of the allocated size of each Socket TX/RX Buffer, it can be accessible within the 16 bits offset address range (From 0x0000 to 0xFFFF). Refer to ‘.3’ for more information about 16KB TX/RX Memory organization and access method.

 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) 31 / 66 3.3 Memory W5500 has one 16KB TX memory for Socket n TX Buffer Blocks and one 16KB RX memory for Socket n RX buffer Blocks. 16KB TX memory is initially allocated in 2KB size for each Socket TX Buffer Block (2KB X 8 = 16KB). The initial allocated 2KB size of Socket n TX Buffer can be re - allocated by using ‘Socket n TX Buffer Size Register (Sn_TXBUF_SIZE) ’. Once all Sn_TXBUF_SIZE registers have been configured, Socket TX Buffer is allocated with the configured size of 16KB TX Memory and is assigned sequentially from Socket 0 to Socket 7. Its physical memory address is automatically determined in 16KB TX memory. Therefore, the total sum of Sn_TXBUF_SIZE should be not exceed 16 in case of error in data transmission. The 16KB RX memory allocation method is the same as t he 16KB TX memory allocation method. 16KB RX memory is initially allocated into 2KB size for each Socket RX Buffer Block (2KB X 8 = 16KB). The initial allocated 2KB size of Socket n RX Buffer can be re -allocated by using ‘Socket n RX Buffer Size Register (Sn_RXBUF_SIZE) ’. When all Sn_RXBUF_SIZE registers have been configu red, the Socket RX Buffer is allocated with the configured size in 16KB RX Memory and is assigned sequentially from Socket 0 to Socket 7. The physical memory address of the Socket RX Buffer is automatically determined in 16KB RX memory. Therefore, the tota l sum of Sn_RXBUF_SIZE should not exceed 16, data reception error will occur if exceeded. For 16KB TX/RX memory allocation, refer to Sn_TXBUF_SIZE & Sn_RXBUF_SIZE in ‘.2 ’. The Socket n TX Buffer Block allocated in 16KB TX memory is buffer for saving data to be transmitted by host. The 16bits Offset Address of Socket n TX Buffer Block has 64KB address space ranged from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF, and it is configured with reference to ‘Socket n TX Write Pointer Register (Sn_TX_WR) ’ & ‘Socket n TX Read Pointer Register(Sn_RX_RD) ’. However, the 16bits Offset Address automatically convert s into the physical address to be accessible in 16KB TX memory such as Figure 20. Refer to ‘.2 ’ for Sn_TX_WR & Sn_TX_RD. The Socket n RX Buffer Block allocated in 16KB RX memory is buffer for saving the received data through the Ethernet. The 16bits Offset Address of Socket n RX Buffer Block has 64KB address space ranged from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF, and it is configured with reference to ‘Socket n RX RD Pointer Register (Sn_RX_RD) ’ & ‘Socket n RX Write Pointer Register (Sn_RX_WR) ’. However, the 16bits Offset Address automatically convert s into the physical address to be accessible in 16KB RX memory such as Figure 20. Refer to ‘.2 ’ for Sn_RX_RD & Sn_RX_WR.

 38 / 66 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) RTR (Retry Time -value Register) [R/W] [0x0019 – 0x001A] [0x07D0] RTR configures the retransmission timeout period. The unit of timeout period is 100us and the default of RTR is ‘0x07D0’ or ‘2000’. And so the default timeout period is 200ms(100us X 2000). During the time configured by RTR, W5 500 wait s for the peer response to the packet that is transmitted by Sn_CR(CONNECT, DISCON, CLOSE, SEND, SEND_MAC, SEND_KEEP command). If the peer does not respon d within the RTR time, W5500 retransmits the packet or issues timeout. Ex) When timeout -period is set as 400ms, RTR = (400ms / 1ms) X 10 = 4000(0x0FA0) 0x001 9 0x001 A 0x0F 0xA0 RCR (Retry Count Register) [R/W] [0x00 1B] [0x08] RCR configures the number of time of retransmission. When retransmission occurs as many as ‘RCR+1’, Timeout interrupt is issued (Sn_IR[TIMEOUT] = ‘1’). Ex) RCR = 0x0007 0x001 B 0x07 The timeout of W5500 can be configurable with RTR and RCR. W5500 has two kind timeout such as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and TCP retransmission. At the ARP (Refer to RFC 826, http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html ) retransmission timeout, W5500 automatically sends ARP -request to the peer’s IP address in order to acquire MAC address information (used for communicat ion of IP, UDP, or TCP). While waiting for ARP -response from the peer, if there is no response during the configured RTR time, a temporary timeout is occurred and ARP -request is retransmitted. It is repeated as many as ‘RCR + 1’ times. Even after the ARP-request retransmissions are repeated as ‘RCR+1’ and there is no response to the ARP -request, the final timeout is occurred and Sn_IR(TIMEOUT) becomes ‘1’. The time of final timeout ( ARP TO) of ARP - request is as below. 𝐴𝑅𝑃 𝑇𝑂= (𝑅𝑇𝑅 ×0.1𝑚𝑠)× (𝑅𝐶𝑅 +1) At the TCP packet retransmission timeout, W5500 transmits TCP packets (SYN, FIN, RST, DATA packets) and waits for the acknowledgement (ACK) during the configured RTR time and RCR. If there is no ACK from the peer, a temporary timeout occurs and 
 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) 39 / 66 the TCP pac ket is retransmitted. The retransmission is repeated as many as ‘RCR+1’. Even after TCP retransmission is repeated as ‘RCR+1’ and there is no response to the TCP retransmission, the final timeout is occurred and Sn_IR(TIMEOUT) becomes ‘1’. The time of fina l timeout (TCPTO) of TCP retransmission is as below.

In addition, PHYCFGR indicates the status of PHY such as duplex, Speed, Link. Bit Symbol Description 7 RST Reset [R/W] When this bit is ‘0’, internal PHY is reset. After PHY reset, it should be set as ‘1’. 6 OPMD Configure PHY Operation Mode 1: Configure with OPMDC[2:0] in PHYCFGR 0: Configure with the H/W PINs(PMODE[2:0]) This bit configures PHY operation mode with OPMDC[2:0] bits or PMODE[2:0] PINs. When W5500 is reset by POR or RSTn PIN, PHY operation mode is configured with PMODE[2:0] PINs by default. After POR or RSTn reset, user can re -configure PHY operation mode with OPMDC[2:0]. If user wants to re-configure with PMDC[2:0], it should reset PHY by setting the RST bit to ‘0’ after the user configures this bit as ‘1’ and OPMDC[2:0]. 5~3 OPMDC Operation Mode Configuration Bit [R/W] These bits select the operation mode of PHY such as following table. 5 4 3 Description 0 0 0 10BT Half -duplex, Auto -negotiation disabled 0 0 1 10BT Full -duplex, Auto -negotiation disabled 0 1 0 100BT Half -duplex, Auto -negotiation disabled 0 1 1 100BT Full -duplex, Auto -negotiation disabled 1 0 0 100BT Half -duplex, Auto -negotiation enabled 1 0 1 Not used 1 1 0 Power Down mode 1 1 1 All capable, Auto -negotiation enabled 2 DPX Duplex Status [Read Only] 1: Full duplex 0: Half duplex 1 SPD Speed Status [Read Only] 1: 100Mpbs based 0: 10Mpbs based 0 LNK Link Status [Read Only] 1: Link up 0: Link down

To use multicasting, Sn_DIPR & Sn_DPORT should be respectively configured with the multicast group IP address & port number before Socket n is opened b y OPEN command of Sn_CR MAC Filter Enable in MACRAW mode 0: disable MAC Filtering 1: enable MAC Filtering This bit is applied only during MACRAW mode(P[3:0] = ‘0100’). When set as ‘1’, W5500 can only receive broadcasting packet or packet sent to itself. When this bit is ‘0’, W5500 can receive all packets on Ethernet. If user wants to implement Hybrid TCP/IP stack, it is recommended that this bit is set as ‘1’ for reducing host overhead to process the all received packets. 6 BCAST B Broadcast Blocking in MACRAW and UDP mode 0: disable Broadcast Blocking 1: enable Broadcast Blocking This bit blocks to receive broadcasting packet during UDP mode(P[3:0] = ‘0010’). In addition, This bit does when MACRAW mode(P[3:0] = ‘0100’) 5 ND/MC/ MMB Use No Delayed ACK 0: Disable No Delayed ACK option 1: Enable No Delayed ACK option This bit is applied only during TCP mode (P[3:0] = ‘0001’). When this bit is ‘1’, It sends the ACK packet without delay as soon as a 3n is Socket number (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). n is set ‘SNUM[2:0]’ in Control Bits sets. 
 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) 45 / 66 Data packet is received f rom a peer. When this bit is ‘0’, It sends the ACK packet after waiting for the timeout time configured by RTR. Multicast 0: using IGMP version 2 1: using IGMP version 1 This bit is applied only during UDP mode(P[3:0] = ‘0010’) and MULTI = ‘1’. It conf igures the version for IGMP messages (Join/Leave/Report). Multicast Blocking in MACRAW mode 0: disable Multicast Blocking 1: enable Multicast Blocking This bit is applied only when MACRAW mode(P[3:0] = ‘0100’). It blocks to receive the packet with multicast MAC address. 4 UCASTB MIP6B UNICAST Blocking i n UDP mode 0: disable Unicast Blocking 1: enable Unicast Blocking This bit block s receiving the unicast packet during UDP mode(P[3:0] = ‘0010’) and MULTI = ‘1’.

 46 / 66 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) Sn_CR ( Socket n Command Register) [R/W] [0x0001] [0x00] This is used to set the command for Socket n such as OPEN, CLOSE, CONNECT, LISTEN, SEND, and RECEIVE. After W5500 accepts the command, the Sn_CR register is automatically cleared to 0x00. Even though Sn_CR is cleared to 0x00, the command is still being processed. To check whether the command is completed or not, please check the Sn_IR or Sn_SR. Value Symbol Description 0x01 OPEN Socket n is initialized and opened according to the protocol selected in Sn_MR (P3:P0). The table below shows the value of Sn_SR corresponding to Sn_MR. Sn_MR (P[3:0]) Sn_SR Sn_MR_CLOSE (‘0000’) - Sn_MR_TCP (‘0001’) SOCK_INIT (0x13) Sn_MR_UDP (‘0010’) SOCK_UDP (0x22) S0_MR_MACRAW (‘0100’) SOCK_MACRAW (0x02). 0x02 LISTEN This is valid only in TCP mode (Sn_MR(P3:P0) = Sn_MR_TCP). In this mode, Socket n operates as a ‘TCP server’ and waits for connection -request (SYN packet) from any ‘TCP client’. The Sn_SR changes the state from SOCK_INIT to SOCKET_LISTEN. When a ‘TCP client ’ connection request is successfully established, the Sn_SR changes from SOCK_LISTEN to SOCK_ESTABLISHED and the Sn_IR(0) becomes ‘1’. But when a ‘TCP client’ connection request is failed, Sn_IR(3) becomes ‘1’ and the status of Sn_SR changes to SOCK_CLOSED. 0x04 CONNECT This is valid only in TCP mode and operates when Socket n acts as ‘TCP client’. To connect, a connect -request (SYN packet) is sent to ‘TCP server’ configured by Sn_DIPR & Sn_DPORT(destination address & port). If the connec t-request is successful, the Sn_SR is changed to SOCK_ESTABLISHED and the Sn_IR(0) becomes ‘1’. The connect -request fails in the following three cases. 1. When a ARP TO occurs (Sn_IR(3)=‘1’) because the destination hardware address is not acquired through the ARP -process. 2. When a SYN/ACK packet is not received and TCP TO (Sn_IR(3) = ‘1 ) 3. When a RST packet is received instead of a SYN/ACK packet. 
 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) 47 / 66 In these cases, Sn_SR is changed to SOCK_CLOSED. 0x08 DISCON Valid only in TCP mode. Regardless of ‘TCP server’ or ‘TCP client’, the DISCON command processes the disconnect -process (‘Active close’ or ‘Passive close’). Active close: it transmits disconnect -request(FIN packet) to the connected peer Passive close: When FIN packet is received from peer, a FIN packet is replied back to the peer. When the disconnect -process is successful (that is, FIN/ACK packet is received successfully), S n_SR is changed to SOCK_CLOSED. Otherwise, TCP TO occurs (Sn_IR(3)=‘1)= and then Sn_SR is changed to SOCK_CLOSED. cf> If CLOSE is used instead of DISCON, only Sn_SR is changed to SOCK_CLOSED without disconnect -process. If a RST packet is received from a peer during communication, Sn_SR is unconditionally changed to SOCK_CLOSED. 0x10 CLOSE Close Socket n. Sn_SR is changed to SOCK_CLOSED. 0x20 SEND SEND transmits all the data in the Socket n TX buffer. For more details, please refer to Socket n TX Free Size Register (Sn_TX_FSR), Socket n, TX Write Pointer Register(Sn_TX_WR), and Socket n TX Read Pointer Register(Sn_TX_RD). 0x21 SEND_MAC Valid only in UDP mode. The basic operation is same as SEND. Normally SEND transmits data after destination hardware address is acquired by the automatic ARP-process(Address Resolution Protocol). But SEND_MAC transmits data without the automatic ARP -process. In this case, the destination hardware address is acquired from Sn_DHAR configured by host, instead of APR -process. 0x22 SEND_KEEP Valid only in TCP mode. It checks the connection status by sending 1byte keep -alive packet. If the peer cannot respon d to the keep -alive packet during timeout time, the connection is terminated and the timeout interrupt will occur. 
 48 / 66 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) 0x40 RECV RECV completes the processing of the received data in Socket n RX Buffer by using a RX read pointer register (Sn_RX_RD). For more detail s, refer to Socket n RX Received Size Register (Sn_RX_RSR), Socket n RX Write Pointer Register (Sn_RX_WR), and Socket n RX Read Pointer Register (Sn_RX_RD). Sn_IR (Socket n Interrupt Register) [R] [0x0002] [0x00] Sn_IR indicates the status of Socket Interrupt such as establishment, termination, receiving data, timeout). When an interrupt occurs and the correspond ing bit of Sn_IMR is ‘1’, the corresponding bit of Sn_IR becomes ‘1’. In order to clear the Sn_IR bit, the host should write the bit to ‘1’. 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Reserved Reserved Reserved SEND_OK TIMEOUT RECV DISCON CON Bit Symbol Description 7~5 Reserved Reserved 4 SEND_OK Sn_IR(SENDOK) Interrupt This is issued when SEND command is completed. 3 TIMEOUT Sn_IR(TIMEOUT) Interrupt This is issued when ARP TO or TCP TO occurs. 2 RECV Sn_IR(RECV) Interrupt This is issued whenever data is received from a peer. 1 DISCON Sn_IR(DISCON) Interrupt This is issued when FIN or FIN/ACK packet is received from a peer. 0 CON Sn_IR(CON) Interrupt This is issued one time when the connection with peer is successful and then Sn_SR is changed to SOCK_ESTABLISHED. 
 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) 49 / 66 Sn_SR ( Socket n Status Register) [R] [ 0x0003 ] [0x00] Sn_SR indicates the status of Sock et n. The status of Socket n is changed by Sn_CR or some special control packet as SYN, FIN packet in TCP. Value Symbol Description 0x00 SOCK_CLOSED This indicates that Socket n is released. When DICON, CLOSE command is ordered, or when a timeout occurs, it is changed to SOCK_CLOSED regardless of previous status. 0x13 SOCK_INIT This indicates Socket n is opened with TCP mode. It is changed to SOCK_INIT when Sn_MR (P[3:0]) = ‘0001’ and OPEN command is ordered. After SOCK_INIT, user can use LISTEN /CONNECT command. 0x14 SOCK_LISTEN This indicates Socket n is operating as ‘TCP server’ mode and waiting for connection -request (SYN packet) from a peer (‘TCP client’). It will change to SOCK_ESTALBLISHED when the connection - request is successfully accepted. Otherwise it will change to SOCK_CLOSED after TCPTO occurred (Sn_IR(TIMEOUT) = ‘1’). 0x17 SOCK_ESTABLISHED This indicates the status of the connection of Socket n. It changes to SOCK_ESTABLISHED when the ‘TCP SERVER’ processed the SYN packet from the ‘TCP CLIENT’ during SOCK_LISTEN, or when the CONNECT command is successful. During SOCK_ESTABLISHED, DATA packet can be transferred using SEND or RECV command. 0x1C SOCK_CLOSE_WAIT This indicates Socket n received the disconnect -request (FIN packet) from the connected peer. This is half -closing status, and data can be transferred. For full -closing, DISCON command is used. But For just -closing, CLOSE command is used. 0x22 SOCK_UDP This indicates Socket n is opened in UD P mode(Sn_MR(P[3:0]) = ‘0010’). It changes to SOCK_ UDP when Sn_MR(P[3:0]) = ‘0010’) and OPEN command is ordered. Unlike TCP mode, data can be transfered without the connection -process. 
 50 / 66 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) 0x42 SOCK_MACRAW This indicates Socket 0 is opened in MACRAW mode (S0_MR(P[3:0]) = ‘0100’)and is valid only in Socket 0. It changes to SOCK_MACRAW when S0_MR(P[3:0] = ‘0100’ and OPEN command is ordered. Like UDP mode socket, MACRAW mode Socket 0 can transfer a MAC packet (Ethernet frame) without the connection - process. The following table show s a temporary status indicated during changing the status of Socket n. Value Symbol Description 0x15 SOCK_SYNSENT This indicates Socket n sent the connect -request packet (SYN packet) to a peer. It is temporarily shown when Sn_SR is changed from SOCK_INIT to SOCK_ESTABLISHED by CONNECT command. If connect -accept(SYN/ACK packet) is received from the peer at SOCK_SYNSENT, it changes to SOCK_ESTABLISHED. Otherwise, it changes to SOCK_CLOSED after TCPTO (Sn_IR[TIMEOUT] = ‘1’) is occur red. 0x16 SOCK_SYNRECV It indicates Socket n successfully received the connect - request packet (SYN packet) from a peer. If socket n sends the response (SYN/ACK packet) to the peer successfully, it changes to SOCK_ESTABLISHED. If not, it changes to SOCK_CLOSED after timeout occurs (Sn_IR[TIMEOUT] = ‘1’). 0x18 SOCK_FIN_WAIT These indicate Socket n is closing. These are shown in disconnect -process such as active -close and passive -close. When Disconnect -process is successfully completed, or when timeout occurs, these change to SOCK_CLOSED. 0x1A SOCK_CLOSING 0X1B SOCK_TIME_WAIT 0X1D SOCK_LAST_ACK This indicates Socket n is waiting for the response (FIN/ACK packet) to the disconnect -request (FIN packet) by passive - close. It changes to SOCK_CLOSED when Socket n received the response successfully, or when timeout occurs (Sn_IR[TIMEOUT] = ‘1’). 
 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) 51 / 66 Sn_PORT ( Socket n Source Port Register) [R/W] [ 0x0004 -0x0005 ] [0x0000] Sn_PORT configures the source port number of Socket n. It is valid when Socket n is used in TCP/ UDP mode. It should be set before OPEN command is ordered. Ex) In case of Socket 0 Port = 5000(0x1388), configure as below, 0x0004 0x0005 0x13 0x88 Sn_DHAR ( Socket n Destination Hardware Address Register) [R/W] [0x0006 -0x000B] [0xFFFFFFFFFFFF] Sn_DHAR configures the destination hardware address of Socket n when using SEND_MAC command in UDP mode or it indicates that it is acquired in ARP -process by CONNECT/SEND command. Ex) In case of Socket 0 Destination Hardware address = 08.DC.00.01.02.10, config ure as below. 0x0006 0x0007 0x0008 0x0009 0x000A 0x000B 0x08 0xDC 0x00 0x01 0x02 0x0A 
 52 / 66 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) Sn_DIPR ( Socket n Destination IP Address Register) [R/W] [0x000C -0x000F] [0x00000000] Sn_DIPR configures or indicates the destination IP address of Socket n. It is valid when Socket n is used in TCP/UDP mode. In TCP client mode, it configures an IP address of ‘TCP server’ before CONNECT command. In TCP server mode, it indicates an IP address of ‘T CP client’ after successfully establishing connection. In UDP mode, it configures an IP address of peer to be received the UDP packet by SEND or SEND_MAC command. Ex) In case of Socket 0 Destination IP address = 192.168.0.11, configure as below. 0x000C 0x000D 0x000E 0x000F 192 (0xC0) 168 (0xA8) 0 (0x00) 11 (0x0B) Sn_DPORT ( Socket n Destination Port Register) [R/W] [0x0010 -0x0011] [0x00] Sn_DPORT configures or indicates the destination port number of Socket n. It is valid when Socket n is used in TCP/UDP mode. In TCP client mode, it configures the listen port number of ‘TCP server’ before CONNECT command. In TCP server mode, it indicates the port number of ‘TCP client ’ after successfully establishing connection. In UDP mode, it configures the port number of peer to be transmitted the UDP packet by SEND/SEND_MAC command. Ex) In case of Socket 0 Destination Port = 5000(0x1388), configure as below, 0x0010 0x0011 0x13 0x88 
 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) 53 / 66 Sn_MSS R (Socket n Maximum Segment Size Register) [R/W] [0x0012 -0x0013] [0x0000] Sn_MSSR configures or indicates the MTU(Maximum Transfer Unit) of Socket n. The default MTU is valid when Socket n is used in TCP / UDP mode. However, when in PPPoE mode(MR[PPPoE] = ‘1’), it is determined within PPPoE MTU. Mode Normal (MR(PPPoE)=‘0’) PPPoE (MR(PPPoE)=‘1’) Default MTU Range Default MTU Range TCP 1460 1 ~ 1460 1452 1 ~ 1452 UDP 1472 1 ~ 1472 1464 1 ~ 1464 MACRAW 1514 When Socket n is used in MACRAW mode, the default MTU is applied because the MTU is not processed internally. Therefore, when transmitting the data bigger than default MTU, the host should manually divide the data into the unit of default MTU. When Socket n is used in TCP/UDP mode, and transmitting data bigger than MTU, the data is automatically divided into the unit of MTU. In UDP mode, because there is no such connection -process like in TCP mode, the configured MTU is used. When transmitting data to a peer with the different MTU size, the ICMP(Fragment MTU) packet might be received. In this case, IR(FMTU) becomes ‘1’ and the peer information such as the MTU size and IP address is indicated from FMTUR and UIPR respectively. If IR[MTU] = ‘1’, user cannot transmit data to the peer. To resume the communication with peer, do as follow ed. 1. Close the Socket n by CLOSE command. 2. Set Sn_MSS to the indicated MTU from FMTUR 3. Open the Socket n by OPEN com mand 4. Resume the communication with the peer. Ex) In case of Socket 0 MSS = 1460 (0x05B4), configure as below, 0x0012 0x0013 0x05 0xB4 Sn_TOS ( Socket n IP Type of Service Register) [R/W] [0x0015] [0x00] Sn_TOS configures the TOS(Type Of Service field in IP Header) of Socket n. It is set before OPEN command. For more the detail s, refer to http://www.iana.org/assignments/ip -parameters. 54 / 66 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) Sn_TTL ( Socke t n TTL Register) [R/W] [0x0016] [0x80] Sn_TTL configures the TTL(Time To Live field in IP header) of Socket n. It is set before OPEN command. For more the detail s, refer to http://www.iana.org/ assignments/ip -parameters. Sn_RXBUF_SIZE ( Socket n RX Buffer Size Register) [R/W] [0x001E] [0x02] Sn_RXBUF_SIZE configures the RX buffer block size of Socket n. Socket n RX Buffer Block size can be configured with 1,2,4,8, and 16 Kbytes. If a different size is configured, the data cannot be normally received from a peer. Although Socket n RX Buffer Block size is initially configured to 2Kbytes, user can re-configur e its size using Sn_RXBUF_SIZE. The total sum of Sn_RXBUF_SIZE cannot be exceed 16Kbytes. W hen exceeded, the data reception error is occurred. When all Sn_RXBUF_SIZE have been configured, Socket n RX Buffer is allocated with the configured size in 16KB RX Memory and is assigned sequentially from Socket 0 to Socket 7. Socket n RX Buffer Block can be accessible with the 16bits Offset Address ranged from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF regardless of the configured size. (Refer to Sn_RX_RD & Sn_RX_WR). Value (dec) 0 1 2 4 8 16 Buffer size 0KB 1KB 2KB 4KB 8KB 16KB Ex) Socket 0 RX Buffer Size = 8KB 0x001E 0x08 Sn_TXBUF_SIZE ( Socket n TX Buffer Size Register) [R/W] [0x001F] [0x02] Sn_TXBUF_SIZE configures the TX buffer block size of Socket n. Socket n TX Buffer Block size can be configured with 1,2,4,8, and 16 Kbytes. If a different size is configured, the data can’t be normally transmitted to a peer. Although Socket n TX Buffer Block size is initially configured to 2Kbytes, user can be re -configur e its size using Sn_TXBUF_SIZE. The total sum of Sn_TXBUF_SIZE cannot be exceed 16Kbyte s. When exceeded, the data transmission error is occurred. When all Sn_TXBUF_SIZE have been configured, Socket n TX Buffer is allocated with the configured size in 16KB TX Memory and is assigned sequentially from Socket 0 to Socket 7. 
 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) 55 / 66 Socket n TX Buffer B lock can be accessible with 16bits Offset Address ranged from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF regardless of the configured size. (Refer to Sn_TX_WR & Sn_TX_RD). Value (dec) 0 1 2 4 8 16 Buffer size 0KB 1KB 2KB 4KB 8KB 16KB Ex) Socket 0 TX Buffer Size = 4KB 0x001F 0x04 Sn_TX_FSR ( Socket n TX Free Size Register) [R] [0x0020 -0x0021] [0x0800] Sn_TX_FSR indicates the free size of Socket n TX Buffer Block. It is initialized to the configured size by Sn_TXBUF_SIZE. Data bigger than Sn_TX_FSR should not be saved in the Socket n TX Buffer because the bigger data overwrites the previous saved data not yet sent. Therefore, check before saving the data to the Socket n TX Buffer, and if data is equal or smaller than its checked size, transmit the data with SEND/SEND_MAC command after saving the data in Socket n TX buffer. But, if data is bigger than its checked size, transmit the data after dividing into the checked size and saving in the Socket n TX buffer. If Sn_MR(P[3:0]) is not TCP mode(‘0001’), it is automatically calculated as the difference between ‘Socket n TX Write Pointer (Sn_TX_WR)’ and ‘Socket n TX Read Pointer (Sn_TX_RD)’. If Sn_MR(P[3:0]) is TCP mode(‘0001’), it is automatically calculated as the difference between Sn_TX_ WR and the internal ACK pointer which indicates the point of data is received already by the connected peer. Ex) In case of 2048(0x0800) in S0_TX_FSR, 0x0020 0x0021 0x08 0x00 Sn_TX_RD ( Socket n TX Read Pointer Register) [R] [0x0022 -0x0023] [0x0000] Sn_TX_RD is initialized by OPEN command. However, if Sn_MR(P[3:0]) is TCP mode(‘0001’), it is re -initialized while connecting with TCP. After its initialization, it is auto -increased by SEND command. SEND command transmits the saved data from the current S n_TX_RD to the Sn_TX_WR in the Socket n TX Buffer. After transmitting the saved data, the SEND command increases the Sn_TX_RD as same as the Sn_TX_WR. If its increment value exceeds the maximum 
 56 / 66 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) value 0xFFFF, (greater than 0x10000 and the carry bit occurs ), then the carry bit is ignored and will automatically update with the lower 16bits value. Sn_TX_WR ( Socket n TX Write Pointer Register) [R/W] [0x0024 -0x0025] [0x0000] Sn_TX_WR is initialized by OPEN command. However, if Sn_MR(P[3:0]) is TCP mode(‘0001’), it is re -initialized while connecting with TCP. It should be read or to be updated like as follows. 1. Read the starting address for saving the transmitting data. 2. Save the transmit ting data from the starting address of Socket n TX buffer. 3. After saving the transmitting data, update Sn_TX_WR to the increased value as many as transmitting data size. If the increment value exceeds the maximum value 0xFFFF (greater than 0x10000 and the carry bit occurs ), then the carry bit is ignored and will automatically update with the lower 16bits value. 4. Transmit the saved data in Socket n TX Buffer by using SEND/SEND command Sn_RX_RSR ( Socket n Received Size Register) [R] [0x0026 -0x0027] [0x0000] Sn_RX_RSR indicates the data size received and saved in Socket n RX Buffer. Sn_RX_RSR does not exceed the Sn_RXBUF_SIZE and is calculated as the difference between ‘Socket n RX Write Pointer (Sn_RX_WR)’ and ‘Socket n RX Read Pointer (Sn_RX_RD)’. Ex) In case of 2048(0x0800) in S0_RX_RSR, 0x0026 0x0027 0x08 0x00 Sn_RX_RD ( Socket n RX Read Data Pointer Register) [R/W] [0x0028 -0x0029] [0x0000] Sn_RX_RD is initialized by OPEN command. Make sure to be read or updated as follow s. 1. Read the starting save address of the received data 2. Read data from the starting address of Socket n RX Buffer. 3. After reading the received data, Update Sn_RX_RD to the increased value as many as the reading size. If the increment value exceeds the maximum value 0xFFFF, that is, is greater than 0x10000 and the carry bit occurs, update with the lower 16bits value ignored the carry bit. 4. Order RECV command is for notifying the updated Sn_RX_RD to W5500. 
 W5500 Datasheet Version1.0. 2 (November 2013) 57 / 66 Ex) In case of 2048(0x0800) in S0_RX_RD, 0x0028 0x0029 0x08 0x00 Sn_RX_WR ( Socket n RX Write Pointer Register) [R] [0x002A -0x002B] [0x0000] Sn_RX_WR is initialized by OPEN command and it is auto -increased by the data reception. If the increased value exceeds the maximum value 0xFFFF, (greater than 0x10000 and the carry bit occurs ), then the carry bit is ignored and will automatically update with the lower 16bits value. Ex) In case of 2048(0x0800) in S0_RX_WR, 0x002A 0x002B 0x08 0x00 Sn_IMR ( Socket n Interrupt Mask Register) [R/W] [0x002C ] [0xFF] Sn_IMR masks the interrupt of Socket n. Each bit corresponds to each bit of Sn_IR. When a Socket n Interrupt is occurred and the corresponding bit of Sn_IMR is ‘1’, the corresponding bit of Sn_IR becomes ‘1’. When both the corresponding bit of Sn_IMR and Sn_IR are ‘1’ and the n -th bit of IR is ‘1’, Host is interrupted by asserted INTn PIN to low. 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Reserved Reserved Reserved SEND_OK TIMEOUT RECV DISCON CON Bit Symbol Description 7~5 Reserved Reserved 4 SENDOK Sn_IR(SENDOK) Interrupt Mask 3 TIMEOUT Sn_IR(TIMEOUT) Interrupt Mask 2 RECV Sn_IR(RECV) Interrupt Mask 1 DISCON Sn_IR(DISCON) Interrupt Mask 0 CON Sn_IR(CON) Interrupt Mask

Ex) Sn_FRAG0 = 0x0000 (Don’t Fragment) 0x002D 0x002E 0x00 0x00 Sn_KPALVTR (Socket n Keep Alive Time Register) [R/W] [0x002F] [0x00] Sn_KPALVTR configures the transmitting timer of ‘KEEP ALIVE(KA)’ packet of SOCKETn. It is valid only in TCP mode, and ignored in other modes. The time unit is 5s. KA packet is transmittable after Sn_SR is changed to SOCK_ESTABLISHED and after the data is transmitt ed or receiv ed to/from a peer at least once. In case of 'Sn_KPALVTR > 0', W5500 automatically transmits KA packet after time -period for checking the TCP connection (Auto -keepalive -process). In case of 'Sn_KPALVTR = 0', Auto-keep-alive-process will not operate, and KA packet can be transmitted by SEND_KEEP comman d by the host (Manual -keep-alive-process). Manual -keep-aliveprocess is ignored in case of 'Sn_KPALVTR > 0'. Ex) Sn_KPALVTR = 10 (Keep Alive packet will be transmitted every 50 seconds.) 0x002F 0x0A
