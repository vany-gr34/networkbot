"please ensure that javascript is enabled in your browser to view this page. i hadnt been so excited to get my hands on a new device in years, but didthe eufymake uv printer e1live up to my hopes or leave me disappointed? read on to learn all about this unique machine and my feelings about it. if youd rather see a quick overview than read a written review, you can see my video on my youtube channel ill admit that those were the first questions i had when eufymake reached out and asked if i wanted to review their new uv printer. i consider myself to be extremely wellversed in everything related to maker technology, but uv printing is a unique process that one normally only sees in professional print shops. this machine, being designed for prosumers and hobbyists, is something entirely new. the best way to understand uv printing, in my opinion, is to think of it like a cross between 2d inkjet printer and 3d resin printing. the eufymake uv printer e1 can print in full color directly onto any kinda hard object with a mostly flat surface, and it can do that while add texture and 3d relief. thats possible because the jets are spitting out special ink that cures when exposed to uv light, similar to the resin in an msla 3d printer. and, like a 3d printer, it can build up those layers to create 3d effects. it doesnt replace 3d printing or anything like that, as the variation between the lowest and highest points needs to be less than 5mm. but thats in full color and there are alotof creative possibilities for this technology. no, im not hitting on you. dtf means directtofilm and dto mean directtoobject. dtf is when you print onto film, like you might do for a sticker or a vinyl wrap. dto is when you print onto an object without any kind of intermediary step. traditionally, dto has been used by professional print shops to put logos on coffee mugs and artwork onto canvas or metal panels. you can absolutely do stuff like that with the eufymake uv printer e1 thats a major selling point, after all, but i think there is so much more potential for people with the creativity and ability to think outside the box. the possibilities are pretty much endless, because you can print on anything solid that is at least fairly flat. the specs say that it should be flat to within about 2mm, which is quite a lot of wiggle room. as youll see in the testing section of this review, i tried printing on a lot of different things and it always worked. there is also a rotary attachment, so you can print on cylindrical things like water bottles. several years ago, i purchased a device from thegodthings weird choice for a brand name called the princube. it was, essentially, an inkjet print head in handheld form. the idea was that you could print in fullcolor onto anything. i got it because i wanted to add logos and labels to 3dprinted things i made. i believe there were similar devices sold by several other companies. but the point is that it sounds kind of like the eufymake uv printer e1, right? i was worried about that, because the princube sucked. it was a truly awful product. the advertising was a lie and there were few things you could print onto successfully. on most materials, the ink would just smear. my princube has been sitting in a box for half a decade, because i couldnt bring myself to sell it to and put that frustration on anyone else. fortunately, the eufymake uv printer e1 is not at all like that, which should be a relief to those who were wondering. while they both spray out ink with a print head, that is pretty much the only similarity. the eufymake uv printer e1 cures the sprayed ink immediately, so it doesnt smear. it is never wet, so to speak, because the machine performs a curing pass right after a spraying pass. that name might sound a bit familiar to you. eufymake is a rebranding of ankermake, which made the m5 and m5c 3d printers. as far as i can tell, those printers have been discontinued. ankermake was an anker brand, which you probably know for their chargers and batteries. eufy is another anker brand with a focus on technology for the home. i have one of their robot vacuums, for instance. i actually reviewed the ankermake m5c 3d printer and wasnt at all impressed with it something i was vocal about and that a lot of fans found upsetting. my opinion was that the m5c was mediocre for the price and that ankermake dramatically overpromised on the capabilities of the ai camera. but i decided to leave that in the past and to approach the review of the eufymake uv printer e1 with an open mind. this machine is a big deal because thereisntany competition. this is the first product of its kind to hit the market. the vast majority of uv printers are big, professional machines intended for print shops or manufacturing in large quantities. a cursory search shows that they tend to cost at least 20,000. everything else i can find that might be more accessible to hobbyists and prosumers is questionable. some vevor machines come up in searches, but i dont see those on the actual vevor website. other machines can only print on film. and all of them are the kind of generic, brandless or white label designs that savvy shoppers tend to avoid. more importantly, they all lack the userfriendly features of the eufymake uv printer e1. though i do think those features can be a doubleedged sword, so lets talk about them. dto and dtf uv printing technology is not, by itself, particularly groundbreaking. most of the innovation with the eufymake uv printer e1 is in making that technology affordable and userfriendly for the consumer market, while fitting all of that capability into a relatively small package that can reside on a desktop. with the side panels folded up, the eufymake uv printer e1 is approximately the same size as a carryon suitcase. when you fold the side panels down, it obviously takes up more room. the standard flatbed is 330420mm and the mini flatbed is 33090mm. the latter is a good option if you want to take the machine to someplace like a craft fair, as the mini flatbed fits entirely in the machine. the camera is, arguably, the most important feature for making this printer userfriendly. it lets you see the bed and any objects, so you can place your designs exactly where you want them to go. without the camera, positioning designs would be really difficult. that camera works with the smartphone app and desktop software. you can use those to get find designs created by others look for the ones i made!, prepare your own designs, set up print jobs, and so on. the software makes very heavy use of ai, which i think will be somewhat controversial. there are ai features to create artwork, which is a whole can of worms with ambiguous copyright ownership. but there are also ai features to help you generate the height maps for adding 3d textures to prints. one, for example, creates artificial brush strokes to make the print look like a real painting. another helps with the creation of light painting prints backlit to glow in a satisfying way. lets talk ink. this uses a cmyk cyan, magenta, yellow, key color system, plus white and gloss. the white is usually to provide a base on dark surfaces and to build up 3d reliefs. the gloss is to give the prints a nice finish. all of those inks come in 100ml cartridges. there is also an additional cartridge specifically for cleaning the jets. in my opinion, these cartridges are likely to be the biggest complaint with the eufymake uv printer e1. they should be easier to handle than traditional uv ink bottles and will reduce maintenance, but they are expensive. eufymake says that an ink kit will cost 299 and that will include all of the cmyk colors, white, gloss, and the cleaning cartridge. ignoring the cleaning cartridge, that works out to about 0.50 per milliliter. bottles of uv ink for professional printers, on the other hand, work out to around 0.08 per milliliter. therefore, eufymake ink cartridges are about six times more expensive though that does include the cleaning cartridge. this is the same model we saw and continue to see in the consumer inkjet printing market and peoplehateit. ill let you decide how much that matters to you. but hey, this is hackster and maybe one of our members will come up with a way to refill the cartridges. i wasveryexcited when the package showed up at my door and i started unboxing immediately. everything was packed very well and the packaging looks nice slightly more premium feeling than is typical. unpacking and set up were easy enough, without anything tricky or complicated. you just install the cartridges and flatbed, let the machine calibrate itself, link it in the app, and then start printing. the automatic calibration and priming procedure is fairly slow, but i was probably printing within an hour. the eufymake uv printer e1 feels wellmade, with quality materials. it is sturdy and though there is a lot of plastic, it doesnt feel cheap at all. however, i dont love the shiny black plastic, because it attracts dust and fingerprints like crazy. within 24 hours, the top cover around the ink cartridges looked downright dirty. that isnt particularly important, of course, but it is worth mentioning. getting my first print started was pretty easy. the software is simple enough to understand and standard flat prints are simple. just capture a snapshot of the flatbed, choose or upload a design image, position it, select the print settings you usually want whitecmyk, then start! those flat prints are pretty fast, too. not as fast as an inkjet printer, but most small items usually only take a few minutes. it is when you get into 3d textures and reliefs that print times get really long often several hours. speaking of, setting up those textured print jobs is a lot trickier. there are several methods for doing so and most of them rely on ai. there are various ai tools and they work in different ways, but they all attempt to automatically create texturesreliefs and do so with varying success. if youre the type of person who wants complete control over everything i certainly am, you will need to put in more work. the best way i found to manually create textured prints was to use vector artwork with layers. in eufymake studio, you can then set a specific height for each layer. i did that to print a donut onto a 45 vinyl record probably my favorite piece among my tests. i wanted the frosting to sit above the donut, and then sprinkles to sit above the frosting. to achieve that, i started with an overhead image of the donut. then i stretchedwarped that image to make the center hole big enough to go around the label on the record. next, i used inkscape to do an image trace operation and simplify the image down to vectors 20 colors. finally, in eufymake studio, i set a height for each of those vectors. it turned out great! however, that is more of a 2.5d design than a full 3d design. the ideal way to create true 3d textures would be with something like a grayscale height map. unfortunately, eufymake studio doesnt currently support that. but my contact told me that they will be updating the software soon to allow something along those lines. in the meantime, well need to rely on the ai features or 2.5d vector artwork. the ai features are hitormiss in my experience. they do create 3d textures, but whether that looks how you expect is up to chance. and trying isnt free. to use those ai features, you need to use credits. those credits cost money and youll have to keep buying them to keep using the ai features. for that reason, i believe it isabsolutely criticalthat eufymake studio get an update for robust manual texturing tools immediately. they can keep the ai features for people that want them and are okay with paying for them, but the rest of us will demand an alternative. in the time since the eufymake uv printer e1 showed up at my door, i have been running as many print jobs as i can. ive printed on all kinds of things canvas, wood, ceramic magnets, ceramic coasters, pcbs, sticker film, metal bottles, plastic, 3dprinted plastic, metal, cardboard, and paper. it worked on everything and i tried all kinds of designs, too. many of them my own and some of them from the library in the eufymake studio software. for example, i put the hackster logo, the makers toolbox banner, and the serial hobbyism my youtube channel logo on a bunch of stuff. i also printed more artistic pieces, like this custom zippo lighter. and this canvas painting of my dog and me, which is a photo that was made to look like an oil painting. i also printed this dashing fella onto a phone case. i wanted to test the uv resistance of prints, so i left this sitting outside in the intense phoenix sun for a week. it held up just fine without any noticeable degradation in that time. in all of my testing, i only ran into an issue once. that was when i was printing on that zippo and, for some reason, the white ink just stopped working. i ran it through cleaning cycles and even replaced the white cartridge without luck. eventually, i powercycled the printer and told it to go through the ink injection process and that worked though im not sure why or what the problem was. dtf printing for, say, making stickers is a special process. you print onto paper film with a layer adhesive, spraying the ink onto the adhesive. then you run that through a eufymake lamination machine, which applies a layer of transparent plastic film onto the top so the uv ink is between the adhesive and the transparent film. after that, you can use scissors or the provided paper cutter thingy to trim off the excess. then, when youre ready to stick the sticker on something, you just peel off the white paper backing. here you can see where i attempted to put a sticker with my serial hobbyism logo onto my car. i did a poor job with the application, but you get the idea. it is a bit like vinyl and you want to avoid bubbles. i think this sticker functionality is a neat bonus, but it isnt the main appeal of the eufymake uv printer e1 for me. you can make nice vinyl stickers with a 300 cricut machine or even fullcolor stickers with any old inkjet printer. but the uv printing gives you fullcolor and, in theory at least, better longterm resistance to fading. there are other uses cases for dtf printing, such as making banners. eufymake will even have an accessory for printing really long sheets of film. but i didnt get that accessory and so i wasnt able to test it. the other notable accessory is the rotary printing attachment, which lets you print onto cylindrical things, such as water bottles and mugs. it is wellmade and work just fine with official eufymake blank items. unfortunately, it is quite limited on what shapes and sizes it can accommodate. the design of the drive wheels and rollers prevents you from inserting anything that isnt the right shape a cylinder open on one side, with a wide mouth and at least mostly straight sides. i grabbed a handful of bottles and other cylindrical items from the thrift store to test, but found thatnoneof them fit on the rotary printing attachment. though, to be fair, im sure i could find plenty now that i know what to look for. im also going to look into designing a modification that would allow for more shapes, so follow me if youre interested in that. all of that said, the rotary printing attachment didnt have any problems with the items provided by eufymake. i do have one final gripe, though the camera doesnt work with the rotary printing attachment. so, you have to be very careful with positioning. you can see here how i messed that up when i printed the makers toolbox banner onto this bottle. overall, i think the eufymake uv printer e1 is really awesome and i plan to geta lotof use out of it. there is just so much potential for creativity and i already have a long list of things i want to make with it. im even considering setting up a booth at a craft fair to sell some stuff. i love that you can print on anything, in fullcolor. it is like what i wanted from the princube, and it actually works. and the 3d texture capabilities represent a heaping pile of icing on top. it can make printed artwork look like it was actually painted, as with that picture of my dog and me. and it can add a new creative dimension to a piece, as with the donut i printed onto the record. the camera is awesome and, after calibration, is pretty darn accurate. i printed some emojis onto pennies and you can see that the positioning is very precise probably within 0.5mm. i like that the machine itself is attractive and compact enough to tuck away, and even to bring to the aforementioned craft fair. and, despite the costs, i even like the cartridges. theyre quick and easy to swap without any kind of mess. though im sure ill be complaining as soon as i have to buy some more. my biggest concerns are related to eufymakes potential business decisions. the expensive ink cartridges are one example. the ai features are another. the uv printer e1 is awesome, but business might get in the way. what if, for example, eufymake goes under? will we still be able to use our machines? after all, everythinghasto go through the app or desktop software. there is any way to load a up a file on the machine directly. and what if services for the ai features go down? will we not be able to create 3d textures anymore? those concerns are speculative, of course, but they arent farfetched. weve seen that happen time and time again when tech companies fold, leaving owners with bricked devices. thats bad enough for a 300 zune, but it would really hurt for a 1,500 machine especially if youre relying on it for your income. im just going to say it i love the eufymake uv printer e1. it issocool and is easily my favorite thing that ive ever reviewed. ive had a ton of fun playing with it so far and i plan to keep experimenting with new ideas. this will make serious waves in the maker community and i think it will be a big success. even if i end up being wrong about this particular machine, i think it will kick off a lot of new development in the area of consumer dto uv printing. the tech simply has too much potential to ignore. the uv printer e1s print quality is fantastic and it can print onto just about anything. and those prints are durable and resistant. i am concerned about ink cartridge pricing, as well as issues that might arise from business decisions made by eufymake. but im hoping that wont be a problem or that eufymake will provide a solution if it does. if you want a eufymake uv printer e1, it will launch on kickstarter on april 29th. a standard bundle, which will include the printer itself and a cartridge bundle, will cost 1,899. super early birds on kickstarter will be able to snag a bundle for 1,699. but until april 28th, you can put down a preorder deposit of 50 oneufymake.comto secure a standard bundle discounted to 1,499. hackster.io, an avnet community

"please ensure that javascript is enabled in your browser to view this page. hackster has long been known to host a wide variety of online contests to engage with makers, hobbyists, and engineers alike. these contests invited participants to design creative and unique projects given a specific technology. in addition to getting to showcase their skills, contestants also compete to earn a variety of prizes. duringhackster holidays, a series of new type of challenges were launched, which provide hackster members the ability to work on reference project builds with paid opportunities from brands. one of the current challenges now underway is thesonic sprint ble audio design challenge, in collaboration with nordic semiconductor. the sonic sprint is centered around the nrf5340 systemonchip soc, one of the latest ble chipsets from nordic that features dual arm cortex processors that can be clocked at either 64mhz or 128mhz. furthermore, it supports bluetooth 5.3, le audio, direction finding, a floatingpoint unit fpu, and dsp instruction capabilities. it also includes enhanced security features, lower power consumption, and improved sensitivity when compared to prior generations of ble chipsets. for the challenge, participants were asked to submit project proposals that leverage the nrf5340 in innovative ways. to support their prototyping and development, each selected project will receive nrf5340 audio development kits as well as a sponsorship from pcbway to have their customized pcb built and assembled, free of charge! contenders were chosen on march 26th and the projects consisted of an adaptive directional ble audio speaker, a multilingual audio broadcast solution, and a wireless digital stethoscope. proposed by hackster member misoji engineer, the adaptive directional ble speaker is a project that aims to enable directional audio for broadcasting in public environments. for example, in airports and train stations the system can be used to target individuals over ble earphones or groups of individuals through pa speakers. for the project submission, a sixlayer pcb will be created that utilizes the nrf5340 soc, npm1300 power management ic, cirrus logics cs47l63 dac, and servo motors for controlling speaker direction. in addition, a lithiumion battery will be used to power the pcbs that can be charged via a usbc connection. the project will also take advantage of auracast, a new bluetooth feature that allows a device to broadcast to multiple users simultaneously. preliminary tests have already been done testing speaker outputs, confirming pwm output waveforms, and testing ble time synchronization. alex lynds audiopirate le plug is a multilingual audio broadcast that looks to offer venues, like movie theaters or museums, a handheld device that will let users seamlessly switch between languages during audio streams. the project will leverage a broadcast box that hosts an app that can synchronize the audio playback of mp3 files. the broadcast box is also equipped with the nrf5340 ble module that serves as the broadcasting transmitter. a user would then have their own individual handheld devices that are battery powered and allow them to stream audio and choose a language of their choice. much of the developmental work has already been proven out in the contest submission. however, there are various improvements that need to be completed, such as extending the operating range and integrating a proximitybased audio feature. the last entry picked for the challenge is a wireless digital stethoscope by md. kamrul hussain. hussain is creating this solution for his local community as there are no affordable and accessible devices currently available in the region. the device will listen to a patients heartbeat and lung sounds, broadcasting the information in realtime to a healthcare professionals earphones or mobile app that can record and display the data. harnessing the nrf5340, dsp will be included to incorporate noise cancellation, realtime filtering, and classifications of heartbeat patterns. auracast may also be included to allow broadcasting to many devices. for additional device support and capabilities the npm1100 power management ic will be used along with cirrus logics cs47l63 audio dsp. with project submissions complete and contenders now chosen, the contenders will begin receiving their nrf5340 ble audio dks and will have until may 30th to finish their work on the project. within that time, they will have to prove out their designs with the kits as much as possible and create a custom pcb design that encompasses their projects needs. this will then be brought to life by pcbway through a collaborating sponsorship. a fully documented implementation is required for the final submission in order to receive the project payout and on june 7th the judges choice will be announced for best solution. be sure check back for more updates and information when we reveal the final solutions!

"please ensure that javascript is enabled in your browser to view this page. regular readers ofour fpgadventures serieswill be familiar withmicrochips polarfire soc icicle kitandvideo kit development boards, designed to provide a platform for experimenting with the flexible polarfire soc a highperformance lowpower part that combines a fieldprogrammable gate array fpga fabric with hard riscv cpu cores. now, theyre joined by a smaller sibling the lowcost yet featurerich polarfire soc discovery kit. as the name implies, the discovery kit targets those just setting out on their journey with polarfire soc parts bringing down the barrier to entry with a far lower purchase price than its predecessors. while that does mean the loss of a few features, the discovery kit retains everything you need to get started working with baremetal riscv, embedded linux, and libero socbased fpga development. lets take the new board for a spin, and see how it stacks up against its predecessors. the polarfire soc discovery kit is the smallest in microchips polarfire soc board family yet, coming in at around 4.13.3 a massive reduction in size compared to the 7.35.3 polarfire soc icicle kit which preceded it. the chip at its heart has also shrunk rather than the polarfire soc mpfs250tfcvg484ees of the icicle kit with its 256k logic elements les, the discovery kit comes with the more compact mpfs095t1fcsg325e offering 93k les. a quick look at the specs sheet reveals where other areas have been trimmed, too. where the icicle kit comes with 2gb of lpddr4 memory, the discovery kit has only 1gb where theres 8gb of emmc storage onboard the icicle kit, the discovery kit needs you to add a microsd card to your shopping basket the icicle kits two ethernet ports have been reduced to one on the discovery kit, though thankfully this still retains its gigabit performance. anyone planning to work with highspeed peripherals will be disappointed to find the pci express slot of the icicle kit entirely removed, though its hardly surprising given the size of the discovery kit. not all spacesaving decisions are unwelcome, though the somewhatconfusing three microusb ports of the icicle kit have been ditched in favor of a single usb typec port, which handily pulls double duty as a tripleuart serial bus and interface to the embedded flashpro 5 programmer youll need no additional hardware to blow your designs onto the polarfire socs fpga fabric. other features that have survived the downsizing include a full raspberry pistyle 40pin generalpurpose inputoutput gpio header installed, as with microchips earlier boards, at 180 degrees to the raspberry pi standard so addon boards hang off rather than over the board, a mikrobus header, and an eightway useraccessible dip switch array plus two pushbuttons switches alongside eight useraccessible debug leds. theres even a header for an optional eightdigit sevensegment led daughterboard, though sadly this is not included in the box. you wont find any kind of display output on the board, either, which given the lack of graphics processor on the polarfire soc is understandable. flip the board over, though, and you will find a welcome surprise a mipi rx port, designed to be compatible with the raspberry pi camera module range of camera serial interface csi image sensor modules. finally, theres a dc jack for optional 5v power when the board cant be driven over its usb typec connector a revision 2 upgrade over a barewire input on the original revision 1, as pictured. interestingly, microchip recommends, though does not supply, a 5v 3a power supply but in our testing the board rarely went above a 0.65a draw. the outofbox experience of the discovery kit is a lot like the icicle kit, and the video kit too, and centers around the puzzle of getting libero soc microchips fpga design suite set up and licensed. compared to when we first sat down with the icicle kit, back in 2022, things have improved slightly the mandatory licensing server now installs automatically with libero soc itself, rather than being hidden away as a distinct download elsewhere on microchips website. beyond that, though, its a familiar story. if youre new to the microchip ecosystem, the first thing youll have to do is sign up for microchip direct. from there you can download libero soc for windows and selected linux distributions, though not macos and if youre looking to follow all microchips tutorials aswritten, youll need two versions installed sidebyside libero soc 2023.2 and libero soc 2024.1. once installed, youll need to generate a license before you can actually run libero soc theres no trial period or featurelimited free tier, though like the icicle and video kits the discovery kit includes a lifetimerenewable silver license as standard. head to the licensing side of microchip direct and youll be asked to enter your computers mac address taken in an effort to tie the license to a single machine, though with the caveat that it gets easily confused by devices with multiple network cards and then wait up to 45 minutes for the license to arrive via email. when you get the license, youll need to edit the file in order to add your machines hostname and the paths of the various licensing binaries. finally, you move the license file into the same folder as said binaries and execute the licensing server. if this all sounds like a complete faff, it is and after 12 months youll need to generate an allnew license, edit it again, and move it into place, as the bundled libero soc silver license lasts only one year per generation. this has been a pain point for as long as libero soc has existed, but as the cost of compatible fpga development boards falls it becomes increasingly hard to defend. given microchips interest in seeing the discovery kit picked up by universities as a teaching tool, its particularly glaring a course would easily burn through the first scheduled lesson simply getting the software set up and licensed on students own machines. things arent helped by microchips continued insistence in splitting up documentation the discovery kit user guide links you out to no fewer than four other documents as part of its software settings section. the discovery kit comes with a new bit of software, too, not previously seen in the icicle and video kits a graphical user interface for microchips demo application, a finite impulse response fir filter running on the polarfire socs fpga fabric. this, sadly, is windowsexclusive and youll need either libero soc or the licensefree flashpro express installed on the same system in order to get the necessary usb uart drivers in place. the fir demo, dubbed application note 5165, is a preprepared design, created using libero soc, which implements a 127tap fir filter with reloadable coefficients, a 256point fast fourier transform fft filter, and a uart interface to the host machines graphical interface developed for microchip by national instruments. after installing either libero soc or flashpro express and the national instruments gui on a windows 10 or windows 11 machine with a free usb port, the precompiled job file can be flashed onto the polarfire soc in a couple of minutes. thanks to the boards integrated flashpro 5 programmer, theres no need for separate hardware and its low power draw means all you need is the bundled usb typec cable between the discovery kit and the laptop. once the design is flashed microchips documentation walks stepbystep through using the gui to generate the filter coefficients and input signal, then connecting the the software to the discovery board to send the input to the fir filter and receive its output. what it doesnt do, sadly, is explain what exactly it is youre doing, what youre seeing, or offer any further guidance on experimenting with the fir filter with your own inputs and settings. what it does provide, once again, are links to separate documents for each of the ip blocks used in the demos design such as the fir filter itself, documented in an expansive 63page pdf. a separate guide, linked from the discovery kit product page, appears by the tables heading to offer information on generating a fir filter design yourself using libero soc but in actuality is a simple guide to creating an and gate that uses the two pushbutton switches as inputs and the first of the eight debug leds as its output. the fir demo exists to showcase the capabilities of the polarfire socs fpga fabric, but thats only half the story. as the name suggests, the polarfire soc is a systemonchip meaning it has not only the userdefinable fpga fabric but hard processor cores, a quartet of 64bit riscv cores from sifive plus a fifth monitor core. these run at 667mhz, delivering a singlecore performance around a third again as performant for common workloads as the 1ghz arm core of a firstgeneration raspberry pi zero despite the slower clock speed. like the icicle kit and video kit, the discovery kit can run linux though with no onboard storage youll need to supply your own microsd card. microchip provides a yocto board support package bsp, using which you can build your own distribution for the impatient, the company also offers a simple preprepared root filesystem image you can download and flash to your microsd card. before you can boot linux, though, youll have to flash the fpga with microchips linuxsupporting gateware. this is downloadable from github, in a separate repository to the filesystem image, and flashes in a couple of minutes using flashpro express with or without libero soc installed and licensed in the background. the downloadable distribution will feel extremely limited for anyone coming from a desktop environment. theres no package manager, the ethernet port is configured for linklocal connectivity only with nodhclientinstalled, though once youve sorted that out youre at least given an onbydefault ssh server which automatically logs you in as root with no password required, so anyone playing on a shared network is advised to spend a little time locking the system down before connecting the ethernet cable. an issue for more complex applications and one shared, incidentally, by the raspberry pi zero is a lack of ram. while the discovery board itself has 1gb of lpddr4 fitted, only around 548mb is available to the user under linux. its possible to avoid the outofmemory killer oomk by adding a swapfile, but throughput on the microsd card is slow and constant swapping is likely to wear the card out sooner rather than later. as with its bigger stablemates the discovery kit also supports asymmetric multiprocessing amp, allowing the four cores on the polarfire soc to be split into two separate systems each acting as an entirely distinct device. of course, this limits available memory even further while for those looking to get the most out of the boards resources microchip provides some commented sample code for baremetal use. there are no real criticisms you can level against the polarfire soc discovery kit that you cant also level against the bigger and pricier icicle kit and video kit. libero soc is still a bear to set up and license. the documentation is still spread far and wide, and has a gulf between the end of its introductory examples and the start of the beginnerunfriendly highlytechnical datasheets aimed at professional fpga developers. the downloadable linux distribution is still configured in unusual ways and oddly limited. this time around, though, the criticisms are softened at just 132, the discovery kit is considerably cheaper than any of microchips other polarfire soc devices. it has less functionality, sure, but it has enough to get you started providing youre willing to put in the effort, of course. this, again, was true of the icicle and video kits the discovery kit includes that ohsotempting raspberry pi gpio header and the compact mikrobus header, but no tutorials for getting started with them not from linux and not from an fpga design in libero soc. theres nothing in the tutorials about using the sevensegment display header, either, and no sample projects that use a camera module connected to the mipi rx port. for someone already wellversed with microchips polarfire soc ecosystem, thats no big deal. for a hobbyist, its an opportunity to experiment. for educators, though, it represents a timesink before the discovery kit could be used in a university environment, someone is going to have to spend a long time hunting through various sections of the microchip website and numerous github repositories pulling together disparate details into a coherent lesson plan. if the discovery kit sells well, then, microchip would be welladvised to spend some of the proceeds on developing a single teachers guide to the device a document that doesnt send you to another document that sends you to another document, but instead offers a onestop shop walking you through installing the software, experimenting with the fir filter demo, playing with linux, using amp, baremetal programming, and using libero soc to design something a little more complex than an and gate. if it could use each of the boards peripherals including that mipi rx connector even better. all the hardware is there, and for just 132 the discovery kit is an absolute bargain the mpfs095t1fcsg325e on the board costs over 90 more as a bare component but its now up to microchip to show the world why they should buy it. the discovery kit can now be orderedfrom microchip, priced at 132 discounts are available for qualifying university students purchasing directly from microchip. hackster.io, an avnet community
