Module Overview The RapID Platform Network Interface module contains everything needed including the communications controller, protocol stacks, Flash, RAM, and analog driver. Figure 1 provides an overview of the module. Figure 1 – Overview of Module Components and Interfaces The remainder of this document provides technical details for the Network Interface module and the information necessary to integrate the module into a circuit card. 2. Physical Dimensions and Connector Pinout This paragraph describes the process for installing the Network Interface module in a field device’s application hardware. The process is straightforward and consists of designing a low - cost socket into the application hardware to provide signal interface and power connections. Only a single +3.3V power supply is required. In addition, a UART or parallel interface is used to communicate with a host processor. Any unused module inputs may be left floating. The appropriate pull -up resistors are included on the module.

The module height from the X1 seating plane is 0.715” (18,2mm) as shown in Figure 3. The RJ45 (Ethernet) connector and all LEDs are conveniently located along one edge of the PC board for easy access. Note that the RJ45 and the LEDs are flush with the PC board edge. The Link/Activity LEDs for Ethernet ports 1 and 2 are located inside the RJ45 connector. The power and bi -color LED indicators are on the bottom side of the PC board as shown in Figure 3. All components on the bottom of the PC board are above the X1 connector seating plane, as shown in Figure 3. All components on the appli cation hardware that are within the Network Interface module outline should be shorter than the target system's X1 mating connector to prevent physical interference. The recommended mating connector defined in the next paragraph (SSW -116-21-F-D) has a hei ght of 0.335” (8,51mm). If the recommended mating connector is used, all components within the Network Interface module outline should be shorter than 0.335” (8,51mm).

This socket consists of 4 rows of 16 pins, as shown in Figure 4. The connector reference designator in the Network Interface module schematic is X1. The 4 rows are designated A, B, C and D. R ows A and B are on 0.1” (2,54mm) centers, as are rows C and D. The connector can be implemented by using 2 dual row connectors, 1 for rows A and B, and 1 for rows C and D. The recommended connector for each of these is Samtec part number SSW -116-21-F-D. The additional plated through hole shown in Figure 4 is a mounting hole. It is connected to chassis ground on the Network Interface module. This plated through hole is a 0.125” (3,175mm) hole with a 0.250” (6,35mm) pad.

The power supply requirements for voltage and current are +3.3V ± 10%, 500mA. The 3.3V power is supplied to pins X1B1 and X1B9 and ground is connected to pins X1C1 and X1-C9. 2.5 Reset Requirements The Network Interface module may be reset by the application hardware. Module signal X1 -B8, referred to as MAN_RESET_N is the reset input to the Network Interface module. This input is connected to the manual reset input of the onboard reset supervisor (U2). U2 is a TC1270A voltage supervisor chip which requires a low pulse for a minimum of 10uS in order to generate a valid reset. Since the module does have an onboard supervisor IC, it may be allowed to initialize without an external reset source. Module signal X1 -B16, referred to as RESET_OUT_N, is an output that indicates if the module is in a reset state. The signal will go low to indicate the reset state is active. Regardless of how the module is reset, it will not be available for communication until the software has initialized the module and entered the operating state. Th e time required for the module to enter the operating state is 1.0 second after the receipt of a valid reset pulse or after power is valid if no external reset source is used. 3. Communication Interfaces between the Host Processor and Network Interface Module The Network Interface module requires a host processor, and may interface to the host via a UAR T (serial) or a 16 bit parallel interface. Implementation of each of these interfaces is described in the following paragraphs. 3.1 UART Host Interface The UART Host Interface is implemented using two pins from the Network Interface. These pins are X1 -C3 and X1C4. The signal names for these pins, a s shown in Table 3, are UIC1_ 16 and UIC1_ 0, respectively. UIC1_ 16 is the Network Interface TX signal, and UIC1_ 0 is the Network Interface RX signal. The Network Interface TX signal must be connected to the Host Processor RX signal, and the Network Interface RX signal must be connected to the Host Processor TX signal. Figure 7 provides an overview of these signal connections.

Support circuitry between the Host Processor and Network Interface is required and must be designed into the application hardware. T he host processor connects to a 16 -bit data bus and must use 4 control signals to either read data from the Network Interface or write data to the Network Interface. The Network Interface connects to a 16bit write data bus, a 16bit read data bus, and 5 control signals. Figure 8 provides an overview of these connections. Figure 8 – Parallel Host Interface Connection

Table 1 through Table 4 may be used t o understand the signal names in the schematic. The 16bit data bus on the host side of the interface is referred to as HPI_D0 through HPI_D15. The four control signals are referred to as HPI_OE_N, HPI_CS_N, HPI_WE_N, and FIFONOTEMPTY_N. As noted in the s chematics, it is important that signal pins X1 -A9 and X1 -A8 on the Network Interface connector be tied together when integrating the module on the application hardware. Refer to the “ Host Processor Interface User Guide.pdf ” for a detailed description of the Parallel Host Interfa ce. These documents are found on the Network Interface Tools page in the Developer Portal on the Innovasic website. 4. Considerations for Production and Maintenance There are two methods for configuring and programming the Network Interface module during production of end use systems, a Boot Loader over Ethernet or JTAG. The Boot Loader and JTAG methods can also be used to perform field updates during maintenance for the end devices. The subparagraphs below provide an overview of these methods. Figure 9 shows the connections and devices involved for all three methods for either a module or e mbedded design. Figure 9 – Programming Connections and Devices

The type of programming file used to support this is called a .load file. Innovasic supplies .load files for each software component in the Network Interface. These components are identified as: 
- Boot Loader 
- Unified Interface 
- Network 
- Configuration Data These .load file types are avai lable on the Network Interface Software page in the Developer Portal on the Innovasic website, and can be loaded as described in the “Boot Loader User Guide.pdf”. It is important to note that the BOOTLOADER_EN_N signal must be grounded when the Network Interface powers -up in order to enter the programming mode. This is an important consideration if end use device requires field updates. 4.2 JTAG Innovasic supports programming flash chips on the Network Interface module or embedde d design using the JTAG Connector. The type of programming file used to support this is called a .elf file. Innovasic supplies .elf files for each software component in the Network Interface. These components are identified as: 
- Boot Loader 
- Unified Inter face 
- Network 
- Configuration Data These .elf file types are available on the Network Interface Software page in the Developer Portal on the Innovasic website. Using the JTAG method for configuring and programing the Network Interface re quires a PC, JTAG “wiggler” and programming software, and .elf programming files. The wiggler and programming software may be order ed from Innovasic using part number “RapID -PGMR VMCGR ”. A connector compatible with the r ibboncable side of the w iggler is already installed on the module as shown in Figure 9. This connector must be used in the embedded design. The ribbon cable on the wiggler connects to the module/embedded design connector. The other end of the

Detailed instruction s for loading and programming with the .elf files are provided with the JTAG programming software. Note that it is possible to program blank flash using the JTAG method. This method is useful if a Flash Programmer is not available. Access to the JTAG connector is required; however, grounding BOOTLOADER_EN_N is not required. 5.
