Experiment -1 Aim:Study of different types of Network cables and Practically implement the cross -wired cable and straight through cable using clamping tool. Apparatus (Components): RJ-45 connector, Climping Tool, Twisted pair Cable Procedure: To do these practical following steps should be done: 1.Start by stripping off about 2 inches of the plastic jacket off the end of the cable. Be very careful at this point, as to not nick or cut into the wires, which are inside. Doing so could alter the characteristics of your cable, or even worse render is useless. Check the wires, one more time for nicks or cuts. If there are any, just whack the whole end off, and start over. 2.Spread the wires ap art, but be sure to hold onto the base of the jacket with your other hand. You do not want the wires to become untwisted down inside the jacket. Category 5 cable must only have 1/2 of an inch of 'untwisted' wire at the end; otherwise it will be 'out of spe c'. At this point, you obviously have ALOT more than 1/2 of an inch of un -twisted wire. 3.You have 2 end jacks, which must be installed on your cable. If you are using a pre -made cable, with one of the ends whacked off, you only have one end to install -thecrossed over end. Below are two diagrams, which show how you need to arrange the cables for each type of cable end. Decide at this point which end you are making and examine the associated picture below. Diagram shows you how to prepare Cross wired connection 
Diagram shows you how to prepare straight through wired connection 
Experiment -2 Aim:Study of following Network Devices in Detail 
- Repeater 
- Hub 
- Switch 
- Bridge 
- Router 
- Gate Way Apparatus (Software): Nosoftware or hardware needed. Procedure: Following should be done to understand this practical. 1.Repeater: Functioning at Physical Layer.A repeater is an electronic device that receives a signal and retransmits it at a higher level and/or higher power, or onto the other side of an obstruction, so that the signal can cover longer distances. Repeater have two ports ,so cannot be use to connect for more than two devices 2.Hub:AnEthernet hub ,active hub ,network hub ,repeater hub ,huborconcentrator is a device for connecting multiple twisted pair or fiber optic Ethernet devices together and making them act as a single network segment. Hubs work at the physical layer (layer 1) of the OSI model. The device is a form of multiport repeater. Repeater hubs also partic ipate in collision detection, forwarding a jam signal to all ports if it detects a collision. 3.Switch:Anetwork switch orswitching hub is a computer networking device that connects network segments.The term commonly refers to a network bridge that processes and routes data at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model. Switches that additionally process data at the network layer (layer 3 and above) are often referred to as Layer 3 switches or multilayer switches. 4.Bridge:Anetwork bridge connects multipl e network segments at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. In Ethernet networks, the term bridgeformally means a device that behaves according to the IEEE 802.1D standard. A bridge and switch are very much alike; a switch being a bridge with nu merous ports. SwitchorLayer 2 switch is often used interchangeably with bridge.Bridges can analyze incoming data packets to determine if the bridge is able to send the given packet to another segment of the network. 5.Router:Arouteris an electronic device that interconnects two or more computer networks, and selectively interchanges packets of data between them. Each data packet contains address information that a router can use to determine if the source and destination are on the same network, or i f the data packet must be transferred from one network to another. Where multiple routers are used in a large collection of interconnected networks, the routers exchange information about target system addresses, so that each router can build up a table sh owing the preferred paths between any two systems on the interconnected networks. 6.Gate Way: In a communications network, a network node equipped for interfacing with
another network that uses different protocols. 
- A gateway may contain devices such as proto col translators, impedance matching devices, rate converters, fault isolators, or signal translators as necessary to provide system interoperability. It also requires the establishment of mutually acceptable administrative procedures between both networks. 
- A protocol translation/mapping gateway interconnects networks with different network protocol technologies by performing the required protocol conversions.

Aim:Study of basic network command and Network configuration commands.Experiment -5 Apparatus (Software): Command Prompt And Packet Tracer. Procedure: To do this EXPERIMENT -follows these steps: In this EXPERIMENT -students have to understand basic networking commands e.g ping, tracert etc. All commands related to Network configuration which includes how to switch to privilege mode and normal mode and how to configure router i nterface and how to save this configuration to flash memory or permanent memory. This commands includes 
- Configuring the Router commands 
- General Commands to configure network 
- Privileged Mode commands of a router 
- Router Processes & Statistics 
- IP Commands 
- Other IP Commands e.g. show ip route etc. ping: ping(8) sends an ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packet to the specified host. If the hos t responds, you get an ICMP packet back. Sound strange? Well, you can “ping” an IP address to see if a machine is alive. If there is no response, you know something is wrong. 
Traceroute: Tracert is a command which can show you the path a packet of information takes from your computer to one you specify. It w ill list all the routers it passes through until it reaches its destination, or fails to and is discarded. In addition to this, it will tell you how long each 'hop' from router to router takes. 
nslookup: Displays information from Domain Name System (DNS) name servers. NOTE :If you write the command as above it shows as default your pc's server name firstly. pathping: A better version of tracert that gives you statics about packet lost and latency. Getting Help In any command mode, you can get a list of available commands by entering a question mark (?). Router>? To obtain a list of co mmands that begin with a particular character sequence, type in those haracters followed immediately by the question mark (?). Router#co? 
configure connect copy To list keywords or arguments, enter a question mark in place of a keyword or argument. Includea space before the question mark. Router#configure ? memory Configure from NV memory network Configure from a TFTP network host terminal Configure from the terminal You can also abbreviate commands and keywords by entering just enough characters to make the command unique from other commands. For example, you can abbreviate the show command to sh. Configuration Files Any time you make changes to the router configuration, you must save the changes to memory because if you do not they will be lost if there i s a system reload or power outage. There are two types of configuration files: the running (current operating) configuration and the startup configuration. Use the following privileged mode commands to work with configuration files.

Experiment -21 Configuring a Default Route Topology Diagram Objectives Configure a default route on a router. Background / Preparation In this activity, you will configure a default route on the Cisco 1841 Customer router. The default route configuration uses the WAN IP address on the Cisco 1841 ISP router. This is the next -hop router from the Cisco 1841 Customer router. Step 1: Verify reachability from CustomerRouter to the LAN IP address on the ISP router. a.Use terminal emulation software on the Customer PC to connect to the customer Cisco 1841 router. Use cisco123 for the console password. b.Use thepingcommand to verify if the LAN IP address 209.165.201.1 on the ISP router is reachable from the CustomerRouter CustomerRouter> ping 209.165.201.1 Type escape sequence to abort.

Reflection You can now access the entire ISP network. Write down some issues and considerations to discuss with your classmates about this configuration. Here are two questions to begin with: Is this type of access to the ISP LAN like ly to happen in the real world? Why has the student activity been configured to allow this type of access?
Experirment -22 Configuring Static and Default Routes Topology Diagram Objectives Configure static routes on each router to allow communication between all clients. Test connectivity to ensure that each device can fully communicate with all other devices. Background / Preparation This topology represents a small WAN. Each device in th is network has been configured with IP addresses; however, no routing has been configured. The company management wants to use static routes to connect the multiple networks. Step 1: Test connectivity between the PCs and the default gateway. To determine i f there is connectivity from each PC to its configured gateway, first use a simple ping test. a.Click BOpc and go to Desktop > Command Prompt. b.From the command prompt, type the ipconfigcommand. Note the IP address for BOpcand the default gateway address. T he default gateway address is the IP address for the Fast Ethernet interface on BranchOffice. c.Ping 192.168.1.1, the default gateway address for the BranchOffice LAN, from the command prompt onBOpc. This ping should be successful. d.Click PNpc and go to Desktop > Command Prompt. e.From the command prompt, type the ipconfigcommand. Note the IP address for PNpcand the default gateway address. The default gateway address is the IP address for the Fast Ethernet interface on PartnerNet. f.Ping 192.168.3.1, the default gateway address for the PartnerNet LAN, from the command prompt on PNpc. This ping should be successful. g.Repeat steps a, b, and c for MOpcand its respective default gateway, the Fast Ethernet interface on MainOffice. Each of these ping tests should be successful. Step 2: Ping between routers to test connectivity. Use a console cable and terminal emulation software on BOpcto connect to BranchOffice. a.Test connectivity with MainOffice by pinging 10.10.10.1, the IP address of the directly connected serial 3/0 interface. This ping should succeed. b.Test connectivity with MainOffice by pinging 10.10.10.5, the IP address of the serial 2/0 interface. This ping should fail. c.Issue the show ip route command from the terminal window of BOpc. Note that only directly connected routes are shown in the BranchOffice routing table. The ping to 10.10.10.5 failed because the BranchOffice router has no routing table entry for 10.10.10.5. d.Repeat steps a through d on the other two PCs. The pings to di rectly connected networks will succeed. However, pings to remote networks will fail. e.What steps must be taken to reach all the networks from any PC in the activity? Step 3: Viewing the routing tables. You can view routing tables in Packet Tracer using th e Inspect tool. The Inspect tool is in the Common Tools bar to the right of the topology. The Inspect tool is the icon that appears as a magnifying glass. a.In theCommon Tools bar, click on the Inspecttool. b.Click the MainOffice router and choose Routing Ta ble. c.Click the BranchOffice router and choose Routing Table. d.Click the PartnerNet router and choose Routing Table. e.Move the routing table windows around so that you can see all three at once. f.What networks do each of the routers already know about? g.Doeseach router know how to route to all networks in the topology? After comparing the routing tables, close the window for each routing table by clicking the xin the upper right corner of each window. Step 4: Configure default routes on the BranchOffice an d PartnerNet routers. To configure static routes for each router, first determine which routes need to be added for each device. For the BranchOffice and thePartnerNet routers, a single default route allows these devices to route traffic for all networks not directly connected. To configure a default route, you must identify the IP address of the next hop router, which in this case is the MainOffice router. a.From the Common toolbar, click the Selecttool. b.Move the cursor over the red serial link between th eBranchOffice router and the MainOffice router. Notice that the interface of the next hop is S3/0. c.Move the cursor over the MainOffice router and note that the IP address for Serial 3/0 is 10.10.10.1. d.Move the cursor over the red serial link between the PartnerNet router and the MainOffice router. Notice that the interface of the next hop is S2/0. e.Move the cursor over the MainOffice router and note that the IP address for Serial 2/0 is 10.10.10.5. f.Configure the static routes on both the BranchOffice andPartnerNetrouters using the CLI. Click theBranchOffice router, and click the CLItab. g.At theBranchOffice> prompt, type enableto enter privileged EXEC mode. h.At theBranchOffice# prompt, type configure terminal. i.The syntax for a default route is ip route 0 .0.0.0 0.0.0.0 next_hop_ip_address. Typeip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.10.10.1. j.Typeendto get back to the BranchOffice# prompt. k.Typecopy run start to save the configuration change. l.Repeat steps f through k on the PartnerNet router, using 10.10.10.5 as the next hop IP address. Step 5: Configure static routes at Main Office. The configuration of static routes at the Main Office is a bit more complex because the MainOffice router is responsible for routing traffic to and from the Branch Office and PartnerNet LAN segments. TheMainOffice router knows only about routes to the 10.10.10.0/30, 10.10.10.4/30, and 192.168.2.0/24 networks because they are directly connected. Static routes to the 192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.3.0/24 netwo rks need to be added so that the MainOffice router can route traffic between the networks behind the BranchOffice andPartnerNet routers. a.Click the MainOffice router, and then click the CLItab. b.At theMainOffice> prompt, type enableto enter privileged EX EC mode. c.At theMainOffice# prompt, type configure terminal. d.The syntax for a static route is ip routenetwork subnet_mask next_hop_ip_address: ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.2 ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.6 e.Typeendto return to theMainOffice# prompt. f.Typecopy run start to save the configuration change. g.Repeat steps a through e from Step 3. View the routing tables and notice the difference in the routing tables. The routing table for each router should have an “S” for each static route. Step 6: Test connectivity. Now that each router in the topology has static routes configured, all hosts should have connectivity to all other hosts. Use ping to verify connectivity. a.ClickBOpcand click the Desktop tab. b.Choose the Command pr omptoption. c.Typeping 192.168.3.2. The ping should be successful, verifying that the static routes are configured properly. d.Typeping 192.168.2.2. Notice that the result is successful even though you did not specifically add the 192.168.2.0 network as a static route into any of the routers. Because a default route was used on the BranchOffice andPartnerNet routers, a route for the 192.168.2.0 netwo rk was not needed. The default route sends all traffic destined off network to the MainOffice router. The 192.168.2.0 network is directly connected to the MainOffice router; therefore, no additional routes needed to be added to the routing table e.Click the Check Results button at the bottom of this instruction window to check your work.

Experiment -24 Planning Network -based Firewalls Topology Diagram Objectives Place firewalls in appropriate locations to satisfy security requirements. Background / Preparation You are a technician who provides network support for a medium -sized business. The business has grown and includes a research and development department wo rking on a new, very confidential project. The livelihood of the project depends on protecting the data used by the research and development team. Your job is to install firewalls to help protect the network, based on specific requirements. The Packet Trac er topology that you will use includes two preconfigured firewalls. In the two scenarios presented, you will replace the existing routers with the firewalls. The firewalls need to be configured with the appropriate IP address configurations, and the firewa lls should be tested to ensure that they are installed and configured correctly. Scenario 1: Protecting the Network from Hackers Because the company is concerned about security, you recommend a firewall to protect the network from hackers on the Internet. It is very important that access to the network from the Internet is restricted. Firewall_1 has been preconfigured with the appropriate rules to provide the security required. You will install it on the network and confirm that it is functioning as expec ted. 
Step 1: Replace Router_A with Firewall_1. a.RemoveRouter_A and replace it with Firewall_1. b.Connect the Fast Ethernet 0/0 interface on Firewall_1 to the Fast Ethernet 0/1 interface on Switch_A.

Experiment -25 Configuring a Cisco Router as a DHCP Server Topology Diagram Objectives Configure the customer Cisco 1841 ISR as a DHCP server. Background / Preparation In this activity, you will continue to configure the Cisco 1841 ISR router for the customer network by configuring the DHCP service. The customer has sev eral workstations that need to be automatically configured with IP addresses on the local subnet and appropriate DHCP options to allow access to the Internet. The DHCP pool will usethe 192.168.1.0/24 network but the first 49 addresses are excluded. The default gateway and DNS server also need to be configured as 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.10. For this activity, both the user and privileged EXEC passwords are cisco. Note:Packet Trace r does not currently support the domain name and lease period options. These options are not used in this activity.
