Raj Jain The Ohio State University 2-2OverviewOverview ❑Data Comm vs Networking vs Distributed Systems ❑Types of Networks ❑Protocol Layers: OSI and TCP/IP Models ❑Connection-oriented vs connectionless ❑Layered packet format
Raj Jain The Ohio State University 2-3Data Communication vs NetworkingData Communication vs Networking ❑Communication: Two Nodes. Mostly EE issues. ❑Networking: Two or more nodes. More issues, e.g., routing
Raj Jain The Ohio State University 2-4Distributed Systems vs NetworksDistributed Systems vs Networks ❑Distributed Systems: ❑Users are unaware of underlying structure. E.g., trn instead of \n\bone\0\trn ❑Mostly operating systems issues. ❑Nodes are generally under one organization’s control. ❑Networks: Users specify the location of resources. http:\\www.cis.ohio-state.edu\~jain\ ❑Nodes are autonomous. ServerServer
Raj Jain The Ohio State University 2-5Types of NetworksTypes of Networks ❑Point to point vs Broadcast ❑Circuit switched vs packet switched ❑Local Area Networks (LAN) 0-2 km, Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN) 2-50 km, Wide Area Networks (WAN) 50+ kmWAN Bus LAN Ring LAN

Raj Jain The Ohio State University 2-7Design Issues for LayersDesign Issues for Layers ❑Duplexity: ❑Simplex: Transmit or receive ❑Full Duplex: Transmit and receive simultaneously ❑Half-Duplex: Transmit and receive alternately ❑Error Control: Error detection and recovery ❑Flow Control: Fast sender

Raj Jain The Ohio State University 2-9LayeringLayering ❑Protocols of a layer perform a similar set of functions ❑All alternatives for a row have the same interfaces ❑Choice of protocols at a layer is independent of those of at other layers. E.g., IP over Ethernet or token ring ❑Need one component of each layer ⇒ Null componentsSame InterfacesTrans Control Prot Novell Netware (IPX) Token RingInternet Protocol Ethernet Copper FiberFTP Telnet Web Email User Datagram Prot

Raj Jain The Ohio State University 2-13Connection-Oriented vs ConnectionlessConnection-Oriented vs Connectionless ❑Connection-Oriented: Telephone System ❑Path setup before data is sent ❑Data need not have address. Circuit number is used. ❑Virtual circuits: Multiple circuits on one wire. ❑Connectionless: Postal System. Also known as datagram. ❑Complete address on each packet ❑The address decides the next hop at each routing point
Raj Jain The Ohio State University 2-14Types of ServicesTypes of Services ❑Byte streams: user message boundaries are not preserved ❑Request-reply: The reply serves as an acknowledgement also ❑Message oriented or byte oriented approach can be used for unreliable connection-oriented communicationConnection-oriented Datagram Reliable Unreliable Reliable Unreliable Acknowledged Request-Reply Message SequenceByte Stream

Raj Jain The Ohio State University 2-17OSI vs TCP Reference ModelsOSI vs TCP Reference Models ❑OSI introduced concept of services, interface, protocols. These were force-fitted to TCP later ⇒ It is not easy to replace protocols in TCP. ❑In OSI, reference model was done before protocols. In TCP, protocols were done before the model ❑OSI: Standardize first, build later TCP: Build first, standardize later ❑OSI took too long to standardize. TCP/IP was already in wide use by the time. ❑OSI become too complex. ❑TCP/IP is not general. Ad hoc.
