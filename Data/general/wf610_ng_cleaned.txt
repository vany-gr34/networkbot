Before You Begin 3Before You Begin Make sure you installed ink cartridges and loaded paper as described on the Start Here sheet. Then follow the instructions in this guide to set up the printer for use on a network. Tip: For a video tutorial and other information about setting up a wireless network, go to: epson.com/support/wireless. Do one of the following: ■If you’re installing the printer for the first time, see “Choose Your Connection Type” on page 4. ■If you’re setting up an additional computer to use the printer on the network, follow the steps in “Install Software” on page 24.
4Choose Your Connection TypeChoose Your Connection Type Wireless To connect the printer wirelessly, see page 5. Note: If you want to print wirelessly but do not have an access point or router, see “Create an Ad-Hoc Wireless Connection” on page 16. Wired To connect the printer using an Ethernet cable, see page 23.
Wireless Network Installation 5 Wireless Network Installation To connect to your printer wirelessly, you need to know the name (SSID) of your wireless network. If it has security enable d, you also need to know the WEP key or WPA passphrase. Write down your network and security information in the space provided below: ■Network name (SSID): _________________________________________ ■WEP key or WPA passphrase: ____________________________________ Note: Your printer is compatible with 802.11b an d 802.11g. If your router or access point supports 802.11n (Wireless N), makes sure it is set to compatibility mode to allow 802.11b and 802.11g devices to connect to it. Your printer supports the following wireless security modes: WEP, WPA, and WPA2. If you don’t know your wireless network name (SSID), WEP key, or WPA passphrase, contact the person who set up your wireless network before you begin. If your WPA passphrase contains upperor lowercase letters, be sure to note it correctly. Connect Wirelessly Using the Setup Wizard Follow the steps below to connect to your printer wirelessly. 1.

Troubleshooting 31Setup Problems The printer cannot find or connect to the wireless router or access point ■T ry connecting to the wireless router or access point with your computer or another device to confirm that it is working correctly. ■Make sure that the printer is within range of your router or access point. ■Avoid placing the printer near a microw ave oven, 2.4 GHz cordless phone, or large metal object such as a filing cabinet. ■Make sure there aren’t any access restrictions (such as MAC address filtering) set on the wireless router or access point. If access restrictions are set, register the printer’s MAC address on the router or access point. Print a Network Status Sheet (see page 35) to obtain the MAC address. Then see your router or access point’s documentation for instructions. ■If your wireless router or access point doesn’t broadcast its network name (SSID), see “Connect Wirelessly Using Advanced Setup” on page 9 for instructions on connecting to your wireless network. If your wireless router or access point has wireless security enabled, you will also need to know what kind of security it is using. ■If the printer doesn’t connect to your wireless network, the WEP key or WPA passphrase may have been entered incorrectly. See “Wireless Network Installation” on page 5 to select your network settings again. ■The printer is compatible with 802.11b and 802.11g. If your router or access point supports 802.11n (Wireless N), makes sure that it is set to compatibility mode to allow 802.11b and 802.11g devices to connect to it. ■If your network has a firewall and you did not allow access when you installed the software, you will need to reinstall the software following the instructions on page 24. You might need to contact your firewall provider for assistance.
32TroubleshootingEpsonNet Setup was unable to find my printer on the network 1. If you see a screen like this one, do one of the following: ■If you connected the printer wirelessly, verify that the printer is turned on and the WiFi icon appears on the printer’s control panel. Select Wi-Fi setup using the printer’s control panel, then click Next. ■If you connected the printer to your network with an Ethernet network cable, verify that the printer is turn ed on and connected to your network. Select Wired Network (Ethernet) setup, then click Next. ■If you created an Ad-Hoc wireless co nnection, do one of the following: ■For Windows users: If your computer is connected to a network with an Ethernet cable, disconnect it. When setup is complete, reconnect your computer’s Ethernet cable. ■For Macintosh users: If your computer is connected to a network with an Ethernet cable, you cannot set up your printer this way. See page 5 or page 23 to set up your printer. ■If you’re switching from a wireless to a wired network connection, you need to disable the wireless adapter using the printer’s control panel. Select FSetup on the printer’s control panel, select Network Settings > Wireless LAN Setup > Advanced Setup > Disable Wireless LAN. Select Yes, then press OK. 2. Continue clicking Next until EpsonNet Setup begins to search for your printer. Then continue with step 9 on page 26. 
Troubleshooting 33Software installation failed Make sure that the printer is connected to your network (see page 5 for wireless or page 23 for Ethernet). Then remove and reinsert the CD to reinstall the printer software. Cannot communicate on a wired LAN If you’re switching from a wireless to a wired network connection, you need to disable the wireless adapter using the printer’s control panel. Select F Setup on the printer’s control panel, select Network Settings > Wireless LAN Setup > Advanced Setup > Disable Wireless LAN. Select Yes, then press OK. The printer does not appear in the Add Printer window (Mac OS X) Make sure the printer driver was installed correctly and that your computer’s TCP/IP settings are configured correctly. Cannot access a memory card over the network ■Remove the memory card from the printer. Select F Setup on the printer’s control panel, then select Network Settings > File Sharing Setup > Network > Read/Write. Press OK, then press OK again to update the setting. ■For Macintosh, follow the instructions on page 29 to install an application that allows you to access the printer’s memory card slots over the network. Printing Problems Cannot print over the network ■For wireless connections, print a Networ k Status Sheet (see page 35). If the Link Status is Disconnected, make sure the wireless router or access point is turned on and the settings are correct for your wireless network. ■For wired connections, print a Network Status Sheet (see page 35) and make sure the settings are correct for your network. If the Network Status is Disconnected, try the following: ■Make sure the Ethernet cable is securely connected to both the printer and your router, access point, switch, or hub. ■T ry connecting to another port on your router, access point, switch, or hub.
34Troubleshooting■T ry connecting the printer to another router, access point, switch, or hub. ■T ry connecting the printer to your router, access point, switch, or hub with another Ethernet cable. ■When using TCP/IP, make sure the printer’ s IP address is set correctly for your network. If your network does not assi gn IP addresses using DHCP, you need to set the IP address manually. Printing is slow or the print is cut off For wireless connections, print a Network Status Sheet (see below) and check the Signal Strength. Or check the number of bars next to the WiFi icon on the printer’s control panel. If the Signal Stre ngth is poor or you see only one or two bars, try moving the printer closer to your wireless router or access point. Avoid placing the printer next to a microwave oven, 2.4 GHz cordless phone, or large metal objects such as a filing cabinet. A dial-up connection dial og box appears when printing with EpsonNet Print If you use a dial-up connection for Internet access, you will see this message every time you print. T ry connecting to the Internet using a LAN connection or set your dial-up connection to dial manually (Never dial a connection). Scanning Problems Cannot find the scanner or start Epson Scan ■If network communication was interrupted while starting Epson Scan, exit Epson Scan, and restart it after a few seconds. If Epson Scan cannot restart, turn the printer off and back on, and then try restarting Epson Scan. Check the Timeout Setting in EPSON Scan Settings. For details, see the Epson Scan Help. ■If you have a firewall or Internet security software installed, the search feature in EPSON Scan Settings may not work correctly. In this case, print a Network Status Sheet (see below), click EPSON Scan Settings > Add > Enter address, and enter the IP address manually. ■If you are scanning a large document at high resolution, a communication error may occur. If the scan did not complete, lower the resolution.
