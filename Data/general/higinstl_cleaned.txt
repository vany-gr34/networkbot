Caution To comply with the Telcordia GR-1089 NEBS standard, PoE or non-PoE 10/100/1000 Ethernet port cables that exit from either the left or right side of the switch should be rout ed and tied to the nearest rack metal. Note The grounding architecture of this product is DC-isolated (DC-I). Installation Guidelines Before installing the switch, verify that these guidelines are met. For the clearance to the front an d rear panels, make sure that: –Front-panel indicators can be easily read. –Clearance is at least 4.4 in. (11.1 cm) from the switch’s rear panel. –Access to ports is sufficient for unrestricted cabling. –AC power cord can reach from th e AC power outlet to the connect or on the switc h’s rear panel. –The SFP or SFP+ module minimum bend radius and connector length are met. See the corresponding SFP or SFP+ module do cumentation for more information. –Access to the rear of the rack is sufficient for connecting the optional Cisco RPS 2300 module. For switches with the optional 1025-W power su pply module (PWR-C2-1025WAC) or the 1100-W power supply module (PWR-C1-1100WAC), rack-mount the switch before installing the power supply module. Ensure that the power supply modules and fan modu les are securely inserted in the chassis before moving the switch.
2-4Catalyst 3650 Switch Hard ware Installation Guide OL-29734-01Switch Installation Preparing for Installation When connecting or disconnecting the power cord on a switch that is installed above or below a 1025 W or 1100 W power supply-equipped switch, you might have to remove the module from the switch to access the power cord. Cabling is away from sources of electrical noise, such as radios, power lines, and fluorescent lighting fixtures. Make sure that cabling is safe ly away from other devices that might damage the cables. For copper connections on Ethernet ports, cable lengths from the switch to connected devices can be up to 328 feet (100 meters). Each port must match the wave-len gth specifications on the other end of the cable, and the cable must not exceed the maximum cable length. Operating environment is wi thin the correct ranges. Airflow around the switch and through the vents is unrestricted. Temperature around the unit does not exceed 113°F (45°C). If the switch is installed in a closed or multirack assembly, the temperature around it might be greater than normal room temperature. Cisco Ethernet switches ar e equipped with cooling mechanisms, such as fans and blowers. However, these fans and blowers can draw dust and other particles, causing contaminant build-up inside the chassis, which can result in syst em malfunction. You must install this equipment in an environment that is as free from dust and foreign conductive mate rial (such as metal flakes from construction activities), as is possible. The following standards provide gu idelines for acceptable working environments and acceptable levels of suspended particulate matter: –Network Equipment Building Systems (NEBS) GR-63-CORE (only with the DC power supply) –National Electrical Manufacturers Associat ion (NEMA) Type 1 –International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) IP-20 Tools and Equipment Obtain these necessary tools and equipment: A number-2 Phillips screwdriver to rack-mount the switch. A Torx T15 screwdriver, or the Torx T15 key that ships with StackWise upgrade kits, to install the StackWise adapter. Verifying Switch Operation Before you install the switch in a rack, or on a table or shelf, you should power on the switch and verify that the switch passes POST. For the steps that should be performed to connect a PC to the switch and to run the Express Setup, see the “Running Express Setup” section in the Catalyst 3650 Switch Getting Started Guide at http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/doc s/switches/lan/catalyst3650/hardware/quick/guide/cat3650_gsg.ht ml. Note When you connect the RPS to the switch, put the RPS in standby mode. Set the RPS to active mode during normal operation.
2-5Catalyst 3650 Switch Hardwa re Installation Guide OL-29734-01Switch Installation Planning a Switch Data Stack Warning Attach only the following Ci sco external power system to the switch: PWR-RPS2300. Statement 387 Powering Off the Switch After a successful POST, disconnect the power cord fro m the switch. Install the switch in a rack, on a table, or on a shelf, as described in , “Installing the Switch,” section. Planning a Switch Data Stack Catalyst 3650 switches can share bandwidth by using data stacking. Switch Stacking Guidelines For general concepts and management pr ocedures for switch stacks, see the Cisco Catalyst 3650 Series Switches Software Configuration Guides at http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/switches/cata lyst-3650-series-switches/products-installation-an d-configuration-guides-list.html. A StackWise adapter must be installed in the stacking port to enable stacking. The StackWise cable connects to the StackWise adapte r in the stacking port. For switches ordered with stacking, the StackWise adapters are preinstalled. If the switch is not ordered with stacking, the adapters must be ordered separately and installed. Before connecting the switches in a st ack, observe these stacking guidelines: Size of the switch and any optional power suppl y module. The 1025-W and 1100-W power supply modules are longer than the other modules. Stackin g switches with the same power supply modules makes it easier to cable the switches. Length of the StackWise cable. Depending on the configurations that you have, you might need different-sized StackWise cables. If you do not specify the length of the StackWise cable, the 0.5-meter cable is supplied. If you need the 1-mete r cable or the 3-meter cable, you can order it from your Cisco supplier. The “Data Stack Cabling Configurations” section on page 2-5 provides examples of recommended configurations. Minimum bend radius and coiled diameter for StackWise cables. We recommend a minimum bend radius and coiled diameter for each StackWise cable. Data stacks can be created with up to nine switches in a stack. Note You cannot have a switch stack containing a mix of Catalyst 3650 and Catalyst 3850 switches. Data Stack Cabling Configurations Figure 2-1 is an example of a recommended configuratio n that uses the supplied 0.5-meter StackWise cable. In this example, the switches are stacked in a vertical rack or on a ta ble. This configuration provides redundant connections.
2-6Catalyst 3650 Switch Hard ware Installation Guide OL-29734-01Switch Installation Planning a Switch Data Stack The configuration example ( Figure 2-1 ) uses the supplied 0.5-meter StackWise cable. The example shows the full-ring configuration that provides redundant connections. Figure 2-1 Data Stacking the Catalyst 3650 Switches in a Rack or on a Table Using the 0.5-meter StackWise Cables Figure 2-2 shows a recommended configuration when the switches are mounted side-by-side. Use the 1-meter and the 3-meter StackWise cables to conn ect the switches. This configuration provides redundant connections. Figure 2-2 Data Stacki ng up to Four Switches in a Side-by-Side Mounting Data Stack Bandwidth and Partitioning Examples This section provides examples of data stack bandwidth and possible data stack partitioning. Figure 2-3 shows a data stack of Catalyst 3650 switche s that provides full bandwidth and redundant StackWise cable connections.

2-7Catalyst 3650 Switch Hardwa re Installation Guide OL-29734-01Switch Installation Planning a Switch Data Stack Figure 2-4 shows an example of a stack of Catalyst 36 50 switches with incomplete StackWise cabling connections. This stack provides only half ba ndwidth and does not have redundant connections. Figure 2-4 Example of a Data Stack with Half Bandwidth Connections Figure 2-5 and Figure 2-6 show data stacks of Catalyst 3650 switches with failover conditions. In Figure 2-5, the StackWise cable is bad in link 2. Therefore, this stack provides only half bandwidth and does not have redundant connections. In Figure 2-6, link 2 is bad. Therefore, this stack partitions into two stacks, and the top and bottom switches become th e active switches in the stack. If the bottom switch is a member (not the active or standby switch), it reloads. Figure 2-5 Example of a Data St ack with a Failover Condition Figure 2-6 Example of a Partitioned Da ta Stack with a Failover Condition Power-On Sequence for Switch Data Stacks Consider these guidelines before you power on the switches in a stack: The sequence in which the switches are first power ed on might affect the choice of switch that becomes the active switch and the standby switch. There are two ways to el ect an active switch: –If you want a particular switch to become the active switch, configure it with the highest priority. Among switches with same priority, th e switch with the lowest MAC address becomes the active switch. 3476841 2PWR-C2-250WAC PWR-C2-640WAC PWR-C2-250WAC PWR-C2-640WAC PWR-C2-250WAC PWR-C2-640WAC 3476851 2 3PWR-C2-250WAC PWR-C2-640WAC PWR-C2-250WAC PWR-C2-640WAC PWR-C2-250WAC PWR-C2-640WAC 3476861 2PWR-C2-250WAC PWR-C2-640WAC PWR-C2-250WAC PWR-C2-640WAC PWR-C2-250WAC PWR-C2-640WAC
2-8Catalyst 3650 Switch Hard ware Installation Guide OL-29734-01Switch Installation Planning a Switch Data Stack –If you want a particular switch to become the active switch, power on that switch first. This switch remains the active switch until a re-ele ction is required. After 2 minutes, power on the other switches in the stack. If you have no pr eference as to which switch becomes the active switch, power on all the switches in the stack with in 1 minute. These switch es participate in the active switch election. Switches powered on after 2 minutes do not participate in the election. If changes are made to the stack without powering down the switches, the following results might occur: If two operating partial-ring stacks are connected together using a stack cab le, a stack merge might occur. This situation reloads the whole stack (all the sw itches in the stack). If some switches in the stack are completely se parated from the stack, a stack split might occur. A stack split might occur on a full-ring stack if: –More than one running switch is removed without powering down. –More than one stack cable is removed without po wering down. A stack split might occur in a partial-ring stack if: –A switch is removed without powering down. –A stack cable is removed without powering down. In a split stack, depending on where the active a nd standby switches are located, either two stacks might be formed (with the standby taking over as the new active switch in the newly formed stack), or all the members in the newl y formed stack might reload. Note These results depend on how the switches are connected. You can remove two or more switches from the stack without splitting the stack. For conditions that may cause a stack re-election or to manually elect the active switch, see the switch’s software configuration guide at: http://www.cisco.com/go/cat3650_docs Changes to Switch Stack Membership If you replace a stack member with an identical mo del, the new switch function s with exactly the same configuration as the replaced switch, assuming th at the new switch (referred to as the provisioned switch) is using the same member number as the replaced switch. The operation of the switch stack continues uninterrupted during membership changes unless you remove the active switch or you add powered -on standalone switches or switch stacks. Note A switch stack always has one active switch and one standby switch. The active switch contains the saved and running configuration files for the switch st ack. If the active switch becomes unavailable, the standby switch assumes the role of the active switch, and continues to the keep the stack operational. For powered-on switches: Adding powered-on switches (merging) causes all the switches to reload and elect a new active switch from among themselves. The newly elected active switch reta ins its role and configuration. All the other switches change their stack member numbers to the lowest av ailable numbers and use the stack configuration of the newly elected active switch. 
2-9Catalyst 3650 Switch Hardwa re Installation Guide OL-29734-01Switch Installation Installing the Switch Removing powered-on stack members causes the switch stack to divide (partition) into two or more switch stacks, each with the same configuration. This can cause an IP addr ess configuration conflict in your network. If you want the switch stacks to remain separate, change th e IP address or addresses of the newly created switch stacks. If a newly created switch stack does not have an ac tive switch or standby switch, the switch stack will reload and elect a new active switch. Note Make sure that you power off the switches that you add to or remove from the switch stack. After adding or removing stack members, make sure th at the switch stack is operating at full bandwidth. Press the Mode button on a stack member until the Stack mode LED is on. The last two right port LEDs on all the switches in the stack should be green. De pending on the switch model, the last two right ports are 10-Gigabit Ethernet ports or small form-factor pluggable (SFP) module po rts (10/100/1000 ports). If one or both of these LEDs are not green on any of the switches, the stack is not operating at full bandwidth. If you remove the powered-on members but do not want to partition the stack: Power off the switches in th e newly created switch stacks. Reconnect them to the or iginal switch stack th rough their stack ports. Power on the switches. Installing the Switch The illustrations shown in this section show the Cata lyst 3650-48 PoE+ switch as an example. You can install other Catalyst 3650 switches following the same procedures. Rack-Mounting a Switch To install the switch in a 19-inch rack, follow the instructions described in this section. The 19-inch brackets are included with the switch. Installing the switch in other rack types requires an optional bracket kit that is not included with the switch. Figure 2-7 shows the mounting brackets and part numbers. Warning To prevent bodily injury when mounting or servicing this unit in a rack, you must take special precautions to ensure that the system remains stable. The following guidelines are provided to ensure your safety:  This unit should be mounted at the bottom of the rack if it is the only unit in the rack.  When mounting this unit in a partially filled rack, load the rack fr om the bottom to the top with the heaviest component at the bottom of the rack.  If the rack is provid ed with stabilizing devices, insta ll the stabilizers before mountin g or servicing the unit in the rack.

2-15Catalyst 3650 Switch Hardwa re Installation Guide OL-29734-01Switch Installation Installing the StackWise Ports Installing the StackWise Ports Before connecting the StackWise cables, review the “Planning a Switch Data Stack” section on page 2-5. Always use a Cisco-approved StackWis e cable to connect the switches. Caution Removing and installing a StackWise cable might shorte n its useful life. Do not remove and install the cable more often than is absolutely necessary (removi ng and installing it up to 200 times is supported). Step 1 Remove the dust covers from the StackWise cables and store them for future use. A StackWise adapter must be installe d in the StackWise port to enable stacking. In the default setup, the StackWise adapter blanks are installe d in the StackWise ports. If StackW ise stacking is ordered with the switch, StackWise adapters are alre ady installed in the StackWise ports, and you can proceed to step 4. Step 2 Remove the StackWise adapter blan ks from each destination StackWise port using the Torx T15 Allen key provided in the stacking kit (or a Torx T15 screwdriver), as shown in Figure 2-12. Store them for future use. Step 3 Install a StackWise adapter in each destination StackWise port, and secure it in place using the supplied Torx T15 key, or a Torx T15 screwdriver, as shown in Figure 2-13. Note It is not necessary to remove th e fan modules before the removal or installation of the StackWise adapter. If the installation is performed with the system powered on, the fans must be left in the installed position at all times. Step 4 Connect the StackWise cable to the Stack Wise port on the switch’s rear panel: a.Align the StackWise cable connector with th e StackWise adapter in the StackWise port. b.Insert the StackWise cabl e connector into the Stac kWise port, as shown in Figure 2-14. Make sure that the Cisco logo is on the top side of the connector. c.Finger-tighten the screws (clockwise direction). Step 5 Connect the other end of the cable to the port on th e other switch and finger-tig hten the screws. Do not overtighten the screws.

2-18Catalyst 3650 Switch Hard ware Installation Guide OL-29734-01Switch Installation Installing and Removing an SFP and SFP+ Module Note  Do not remove the dust plugs from the SFP modu les or the rubber caps fro m the fiber-optic cable until you are ready to connect the cable. The plugs and caps protect the module ports and cables from contamination and ambient light. Removing and installing an SFP module can shorten its useful life. Do not remove and insert any SFP module more often than is necessary. To prevent ESD damage, follow your normal board and component handling procedures when connecting cables to the switch and other devices. Use only supported SFP modules on the switch. When you insert several SFPs in multiple switch ports, wait fo r 5 seconds between inserting each SFP. This will prevent the ports from going into error disabled mo de. Similarly, when you remove an SFP from a port, wait for 5 seconds before reinserting it. To install an SFP or SFP+ module, follow the procedur es given below: Step 1 Attach an ESD-preventive wrist strap to your wrist and to an earth-ground surface. Step 2 Find the send (TX) and receive (RX) markings that identify the top of the SFP module. On some SFP modules, the send and receive (TX and RX ) markings might be indicated by arrows that show the direction of the connection. Step 3 If the SFP module has a bale-clasp latch, move it to the open, unlocked position. Step 4 Align the module in front of the slot opening, and push until you feel the connector snap into place. Figure 2-15 Aligning the Module in Front of the Slot Opening Step 5 If the module has a bale-clasp latch, cl ose it to lock the SFP module in place. Step 6 Remove the SFP dust plugs.

Step 2 Disconnect the ca ble from the SFP module. For reattachment, no te which cable connector plug is send (TX) and which is receive (RX). Step 3 Insert a dust plug into the optical ports of th e SFP module to keep the optical interfaces clean. Step 4 If the module has a bale-clasp latch, pull the bale out and down to eject the module. If you cannot use your finger to open the latch, use a small, flat-blade screwdriver or other long, narrow instrument to open it. Step 5 Grasp the SFP module, and careful ly remove it from the slot. Step 6 Place the SFP module in an antistatic bag or other protective environment. Connecting a Device to an Ethernet Port Caution Category 5e and Category 6 cables can store high leve ls of static electricity. Always ground the cables to a suitable and safe earth ground before c onnecting them to the switch or other devices. 10/100/1000 Ethernet Port Connections The 10/100/1000 Ethernet ports use RJ-45 connectors with Ethernet pinouts. The maximum cable length is 328 feet (100 meters). The 100BASE-TX and 100 0BASE-T traffic requires a Category 5, Category 5e, or Category 6 UTP cable. The 10BASE-T traffic can use a Category 3 or Category 4 cable. 34777348XCatalyst 3650 48 PoE+ 2X10G TE3TE4G3G4
2-20Catalyst 3650 Switch Hard ware Installation Guide OL-29734-01Switch Installation Connecting a Device to an Ethernet Port The autonegotiation feature is enabled by default on the switch. In this setting, the switch ports configure themselves to operate at the speed of the attach ed device. If the attached device does not support autonegotiation, you can explicitly set the switc h port speed and duplex parameters. To maximize performance, either let the ports autonegotiate both speed and duplex, or set the port speed and duplex parameters on both ends of the connection. For simplified cabling, the auto matic medium-dependent interface crossover (auto-MDIX) feature is enabled by default on the switch. Wi th auto-MDIX enabled, the switch detects the required cable type for copper Ethernet connections and configures the interface accordingl y. Therefore, you can use either a crossover or a straight-through cable for connections to a 10/100/1000 Ethernet port regardless of the type of device at the other end of the connection. See the switch’s software configuration guide or th e switch command reference document on Cisco.com for more information about enabling or disabling autonegotiation and auto-MDIX. If auto-MDIX is disabled, use the guidelines in Table 2-1 to select the correct cable for connecting the switch 10/100/1000 Ethernet ports to other devices. 100M/1G/2.5G/5G/10G Ethernet Port Connections The 100M/1G/2.5G/5G/10G Ethernet ports use RJ45 connectors with Ethernet pinouts. These ports do not support 10 Mbps speed. The 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps traffic require a Category 5/5e/6 unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable at a maximum cable length of 100 m. The 2.5 Gbps traffic requires a Category 5e/6/6a UTP cable at a maximum cable length of 100 m. The 5 Gbps traffic requires a Category 5e UTP cable at a maximum cable length of 70 m and a Catego ry 6/6a UTP cable at a maximum cable length of 100 m. The 10 Gbps traffic requires a Category 6 UTP cable at maximum cable length of 55 m and a Category 6a UTP cable at maximum cable length of 100 m. PoE+ Port and Cisco UPOE Connections The 10/100/1000 PoE+ and Cisco UPOE ports have the same autonegotiation settings and cabling requirements that ar e described in the “10/100/1000 Ethernet Port Connections” section on page 2-19. These ports can provide PoE or PoE+ inline power. PoE inline power supports devices compliant with the IEEE 802.3af standard, as well as prestandard Cisco IP phones and Cisco Aironet Access Points. Each port can deliver up to 15.4 W of PoE. PoE+ inline power supports devices that are compliant with the IEEE 802.3at standard, by delivering up to 30 W of PoE+ power per port to all the switch ports. Cisco UPOE ports provide up to 60 W power per port for connected devices.Table 2-1 Recommended Ethernet Cables (When Auto-MDIX is Disabled) Device Crossover Cable1 1. 100BASE-TX and 1000BASE-T traffic requires a tw isted four-pair, Category 5, Category 5e, or Category 6 cable. 10BASE-T traffic can us e a Category 3 or Category 4 cable.Straight-Through Cable1 Switch to switch Yes No Switch to hub Yes NoSwitch to computer or server No YesSwitch to router No YesSwitch to IP phone No Yes
2-21Catalyst 3650 Switch Hardwa re Installation Guide OL-29734-01Switch Installation Where To Go Next Note Many legacy-powered devices, including older Ci sco IP phones and access po ints that do not fully support IEEE 802.3af, might not su pport PoE when connected to th e switches by a crossover cable. Caution PoE faults are caused when noncompliant cabling or powered devices are connected to a PoE port. Use only standards-compliant cabling to connect Cisco prestandard IP phones, wireless access points, or IEEE 802.3af-compliant devices to PoE ports. A cable or device that causes a PoE fault must be removed from the network. Warning Voice over IP (VoIP) service and the emergency calli ng service do not function if power fails or is disrupted. After power is restored, you might have to reset or reconfigure equipment to regain access to VoIP and the emergency calling service. In the USA, this emergency numbe r is 911. You need to be aware of the emergency number in your country. Statement 361 Warning Voltages that present a shock hazard may exist on Power over Ethernet (PoE) circuits if interconnections are made using uninsulated exposed metal contacts, conductors, or terminals. Avoid using such interconnection methods, unless the exposed metal parts are located within a restricted access location and users and service people who are authorized within the restricted access location are made aware of the hazard. A restricted access area can be accessed only through the use of a special tool, lock and key or other means of security. Statement 1072 Where To Go Next If the default configuration is satisfactory, the switch does not need further configuration. You can use any of these management options to change the default configuration:. Use the CLI to configure the switch as a member of a cluster or as an in dividual switch from the console. See the switch’s command reference docu ment on Cisco.com for information on using the CLI with the switch. Use the Cisco Prime Infrastructure application.
