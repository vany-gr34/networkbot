how to diagnose network issues,"hi net lords, i am running an environment with an mdf and 9 idfs. mdf is a pair of dell s4128fon. idfs are dell n2048p stacks. all switches are running rstp. i am replacing the idfs with cisco catalyst 9200ls. i would try to run rstp on the ciscos but they only give the option of running mst, rpvst, pvst. we had an issue where one of our stacks was running rpvst and it was not breaking loops, causing a broadcast storm on that stack. i want to make sure i am running the correct spanning tree on these new idf stacks. what do you all recommend i use on the new cisco stacks? i would prefer to keep the spanning tree protocols on the existing switches rstp because we will be replacing each idf weeks apart from each other. btw we are a small to medium sized network with 20 vlans or so. much thanks and happy networking. edit 1 apparently mst mode on a cisco is rstp under the hood. without any customized config, all vlans will be mapped to a single spanning tree instance. this is how rstp works with no flexibility added. mst just provides the flexibility to configure more instances and maps vlans to other instances. rpvst will map each vlan to its own instance. in other words, if you have 200 vlans, you have 200 instances. mst provides the best of both worlds but more setup is involved if you need it. luckily i dont need it! || rpvst is fine up to maybe 200 vlans or so, depending on the hardware platform. after that, mst all the way. || we run mst, even on cisco gear. || i use mst on everything that supports it, honestly. the benefits of rstp, the configurability of pvst, and its an open standard with fairly wide support."
how to diagnose network issues,"hello fellow network admins, how did you become a good network admin? i tend to struggle in my role at times, ive been in networking for about a year and at my current position for about 6 months and i struggle with complex network issues. i can troubleshoot and take care of minor networking tasks like programming ports, creating small config changes, and managing our aps, but there are times when things are just not working, and ill sit there for 12 hours just staring at a config going over it multiple times just to be stumped and not find anything. i usually google things but there are times i cant seem to find a good resolution to my problem which leads me to ask the lead network admin just for them to solve the issue in a few minutes. i feel there is a huge gap in knowledge due to them building the network and me going into an exisiting network that is pretty large and critical. do i suck? do my research skills suck? do i need more time? do i need to study more and read about networking more than i already have? i lack in the implementation i understand how a lot of things in networking well work but its when the time comes to put that into practice that i choke and dont seem to know anything. any advice helps || you need more time and to use your log file. running config for examples. build a command list from troubleshooting. experience is gained over time exploring these headaches. takes years to do things in minutes. rock out with your cli out mate || 6 months is not a long time at all. it seems like you have a desire to get better and want to learn. just keep that up and give it some more time and you will get there eventually. theres always going to be someone who knows more than you so dont let that discourage you. || when the lead admin fixes them. do you follow up with them? what was the issue? how did you fix it?"
how to diagnose network issues,"i saw a technical support role and i like the idea of going deep down in a product line, learning technical chops, but at the same time, i cant help but wonder wouldnt most cases you see related to some bug or need some hot fix if you work in tac or technical support for network vendors like ciscofortinetpalo altojuniper etc, what percentage of your work is due to a bug and how much do you troubleshoot for like a design issue or deepdown on protocol? do they give you formal trainings or just give access to some study links and labs and throw you away into the fire? basically, do you enjoy your role or its just find bugs, rinse and repeat? and for those who moved away from tac to another role, or joined an enterprise, where you able to catchup back to being a generalist? || im not vendor tac but msp tac, but stuff i send to vendor personally is things not working how i expect sometimes bug, sometimes own stupid. but we are fairly adept engineers, there are customers that have config problems. generally you dont go to vendors for design help, they have professional services for that, but they will point out when you have done something wrong. the thing about any sort of troubleshooting you need to understand the specific protocol to be able to find stuff, and understanding what the customer is expecting. || i was at brocade and then extreme when they bought that part of brocade, having previously worked for t1 and t2 isps. being able to get into the weeds on a variety of hardware and software was interesting to begin with. i got access to tools and troubleshooting guides that just arent available to the public which let you pull some pretty deep diagnostic data out of a system. we also had big labs to build customer networks in to replicate customer issues. the majority of the time though we were diagnosing new bugs, or identifying existing bugs in older software, and very rarely correcting customer design or deployment. eventually i got tired of working in tac and being limited to a single vendor, and despite being involved in a couple of cool projects i decided i was happier in the sp space. training at brocade was really poor, just punted us over to global knowledge for generic product training, extreme wasnt much better but as i left they started a big push for in house training and that looks to have been a success. as for when i left, because the part of brocadeextreme i was in dealt primarily with isps i never really lost touch with my mplsbgpospf abilities, and i reckon i even improved a bit to be honest. so it depends heavily on what part of tac you join. if you ended up looking after wireless or security products you probably would find your skills atrophy a bit but if youre a good engineer im sure youd get it back quick enough. || depends on what level. usually when you start its at tier 2 at the vendors i worked at this was the terminology anyway. tier 1 being outsourced support. at tier 2 the cases you get are still maybe 80 configurationdesign issues of varying complexity. weird interoperability issues between vendors. the rest might be diagnosing some bug thats already been fixed and telling them what version to upgrade to or implement workaround. light lab replications. if you have reason to think its a new bug or one that doesnt have a fix out yet it gets kicked to tier 3. tier 3 is a mix of complex nonbug issues and actual bugs. more and complex lab replications, get deeper into the protocols. then if you think its a bug, file the bug with engineering and then you have to manage the customer side of the bug lifecycle. theres quite a bit of formal training both for the product and soft skills. product configuration training, basically the same thing youd take to get a basic certification in whatever product line you are working on. plus various internal trainings for aspects of the product architecture. maybe a month or so of just training if memory serves? then there is ongoing training as new productssoftware is released. taking cases and calls is a ramp up period. i enjoyed parts of it, but i enjoy sifting through log files and stack traces to identify bugs. in my experience it can tend to be more of a call center job vibe than other network engineering type gigs. at tier 2 you are on the phones talking to customers a lot. there can be a heavy emphasis on case throughput, phone schedules, case backlog management. it can be a heavy workload im sure this depends on the vendor you work for."
how to diagnose network issues,"as the title says. i was hired at a manufacturing company as an it support specialist very recently, and 2 weeks in i have realized i am actually the it director and the entire it departmentwe do have an msp. i was very clearly told to not answer tickets because i am not help desk, and i have more important things to do. i inherited a mess of a network, and i have to build everything from scratch. the msp charges so much money to help us on our projects, of which there are many because, again, the network is a mess. to start, the network is on nothing but unmanaged switches whose warranties have expired at least 6 years ago, and i am being generous when i say that. we have 3 waps on the first floor, but there is no vlan, so of course wifi is on the same subnet. the switch that is connected to those 3 waps is a small netgear switch with 45 ports, and one port is completely out. we pay for fiber internet, but of course, with the switches being so outdated, we are not even using a third of that speed that is being paid for! because it is a manufacturing company everything is onprem, and the main server is not only a dcaddns. it is also the print server, the license server for the software used by engineers, the file server, the back up for one of the financial software used by the accounting department. if i am not mistaken, there is some virtualization of another server for another one of the sites, and it is very important that the server stays logged in to the administrator account or else, it will bring down the dc for the other site. and we need to switch to voip asap because the current phone system is going within the next year. money has been the main issue as to why everything is outdated. i am having to build this network practically from scratch, and on a budget. i feel like the reason everything was bandaged together was because of money, but i do not want to make the same mistakes as my predecessor. for networking gear, cisco switches are for sure out of the question. i am looking at affordable options like ubiquiti i have experience with those, and i have heard good things about barracuda. for the time being, we need to keep an onprem server because solidworks, autocad, and other engineering software that requires mapped network drives i had to switch work stations for one of the engineers and i mapped one thing wrong, and it was a cluster fck trying to see where i went wrong. documentation is okay from the msp, could be better. they also inherited a mess and have not been able to really get much done except put out small fires and just do basic help desk tickets for us. they have been discussing migrating us to o365 for as long as theyve been our msp, and its only going to happen now because i am here to oversee the project. for anybody in this sub that has had to fix such a big mess like this, how did you tackle such a huge infrastructure overhaul? i feel like i know more about implementation than thinking big picture. the o365 migration will happen soon, and after that, or actually concurrently, i have to redesign our network, and decide if i want to give that project to our msp which will charge us soooo much money, hire a contractor they may be more expensive, or cheaper, dont know, go with our isp who apparently does managed network services for businesses. any and all advice is greatly appreciated! ||  || whats the approx location, number of computers and devices and most important, the approx salary you were hired with? if youre being paid that of a support specialist but expected to do the job, and salary of a director, thats a problem. || if i were you id ask management for permission to request an rfp from the msp to bring the environment up to date. if management denies your request you know things are never going to change and you will be overworked, underpaid, and underappreciated for the duration of your employment. if management approves your request if offloads all the bad news management is going to get to the msp, instead of coming from you and the bad news may shock management into actually putting in effort and committing resources to improve the environment."
how to diagnose network issues,"hello, i need help on where to search to find my problem. we are currently experiencing an issue, where all networked services pause for approx 2 seconds, randomly throughout the network. i have looked at all interfaces on all switches, and there is no errors. i do however see numbers on input throttle when looking at the z9100 interfaces that connect to my main 3 host servers where that majority of our vms run from. so, we have a bit of a hodge podge of networking gear mostly due to previously limited budget. fortigate fw, 3x mikrotik switches 1 out of band management, and the other 2 are for office endpoint connections, and 2x used dell z9100on switches os9. i would post a picture, but i seem to not be allowed. devicespeeddevicespeeddevicespeeddevice firewall10gcrs35440gz9100on100g lacpserver port 1 10gcrs35440gz9100on100g lacpserver port 2 10gcrs3541gmanagement interfaces the dell switches are running vlti, and each host has an lacp connection to each dell switch. i cannot find any packet errors on any ports, only the previously mentioned input throttle. i dont see any errors or matching queue throttling on the cr354s, and nor the firewall. does anybody know if having the 100g 40g 10g is my likely source ? i am versed in infrastructure, but i dont do enough deep networking to know how to resolve this. i should mention that i am planning an entire network upgrade in the near future, likely with allmost of the same brand just in that decision making process now. || that sounds like an issue i had, just the other way round. my switches were switching quite fast, but the hosts couldnt handle it and kept sending pause frames. in your case it seems the other way round, your servers are shoving data to the switches and the switches are sending pause frames to the hosts. thats known as flowcontrol and is a bit of a pain in the bum to have enabled, since it tells the receiving device to stop sending anything for a bit. none of my networks have flowcontrol enabled. you could try that too, but theres a good chance you might end up with a lot of frames being dropped, because there is a bottleneck. youll need to check your data paths and see what needs to be upgraded. || could be stp topology change || try disabling flow control. packet loss is normal. tcp will ensure reliable delivery and adjust the throughput. if you require flow control for storage layer then separate storage and data to separate switches."
how to diagnose network issues,"hey everyone, with two of my friends, we wanted to set up a shared subnet across our three homelabs, each in a different physical location. to do this, we used our existing infrastructure with proxmox and opnsense. i followed the vxlan bridge guide from the official opnsense documentation for the underlay, i decided to go with wireguard which ive been using for years and set up the vteps just like in the tutorial. at first, for a proof of concept, i just wanted to route the network between our three sites using vni 15. between two sites, everything worked perfectly. i set the mtu of my wireguard interfaces to 1600, as recommended in the opnsense forums, so that my bridges and vxlan interfaces could stay at 1500 mtu. that way, i didnt have to deal with custom mtus or tcp mss normalization issues. i also tested with dont fragment df flag across the internet, and mtu 1600 worked fine without fragmentation between the vtep interfaces of each site through the wireguard tunnel. but when i tried adding the third site, things got complicated. initially, i set up one wireguard interface per site with two peers one for each of the other two sites. then, on each firewall, i created two vxlan interfaces site 1 vxlan1 for vtepsite1 to vtepsite2 vxlan2 for vtepsite1 to vtepsite3 site 2 vxlan1 for vtepsite2 to vtepsite1 vxlan2 for vtepsite2 to vtepsite3 site 3 vxlan1 for vtepsite3 to vtepsite1 vxlan2 for vtepsite3 to vtepsite2 but then i hit a limitation in unicast mode as described in the opnsense guide, i cant use the same vni 15 on two vxlan interfaces. i get this error network identifier x already exists in this socket this caused some really weird behavior fw1 can communicate with fw2 and fw3 fw2 and fw3 cant communicate with each other over vxlan to fix this, i had to do something a bit weird with network bridges by assigning different vni ids per pair of sites fw1 to fw2 vni 15 fw1 to fw3 vni 16 fw2 to fw3 vni 17 i know this is not a standard vxlan setup at all, but its the only solution i found for now ive never done vxlan before . so, on each firewall, i now have a network bridge bridge0 that links the two vxlan interfaces and the physical nic fw1 bridge0 fw2 bridge0 fw3 bridge0 right now, this works, but im starting to realize its not maintainable at all. if i want to transport other networks like 10.8.16.024, 10.8.17.024, 10.8.18.024, id have to either create at least 3 new interfaces on each opnsense firewall 2 vxlan interfaces 1 nicvlan and another bridge. or create vlans on bridge0, but as far as i know, opnsense doesnt support vlans on a bridge interface. or use vxlans native vlan transport, but i dont really know how to do that on opnsense. i looked into multicast vxlan, which seems like the perfect solution for my use case, but wireguard doesnt support multicast, so thats not an option. id really like to avoid using ipsec if possible. so now im trying to figure out the best way to design this network so that its functional reliable fault tolerant and easy to monitor maintainable without adding too much complexity if i want to add a new subnet and ideally performant we have great fiber network it should be great to use it if anyone has experience with vxlan on opnsense or a similar setup, id love to hear your thoughts! im open to discussions about every part of my setup. thanks for your help! || functional reliable fault tolerant and easy to monitor maintainable without adding too much complexity if i want to add a new subnet and ideally performant we have great fiber network it should be great to use it honestly? abandon layer 2 and go for layer 3. then run bgp with your friends and you can exchange routes. everything is better at layer 3. if you are crazy enough to do layer 2, ideally your opnsense should not have any vxlan configuration on it. usually only the endpoints of a vxlan network here proxmox are aware of the layer 2 vxlan aspect, and all the nodes in the middle here opnsense and wireguard only see a plain layer 3 udp packet. || this boils down to how do you extend l2 between sites which is a question that engineers have been trying to answer for 20 years. the right answer is dont. the fun answer is vxlan like you want to do. the easy and expensive answer is metroe. the cluster fuck answer is routing individual hosts between sites and have a hub site. the hacky answer is mpls over gres. but seriously, if you arent familiar with vxlan, let alone a dynamic protocol for an underlay just avoid it and do layer 3. it saves a lot of heartache especially if you dont get any benefit from extending l2. || im a big vxlan guy. probably setup a dozen very large ip fabrics in my time. but it works best as a lan tool, low latency, with many paths supported by a layer 3 underlay. for your use case you are over complicating what you need. just go l3. vxlan isnt meant to bridge a broadcast domain over the wan."
how to diagnose network issues,"hey everyone. i have been reading and hanging out in this sub for quite a while but this is my first time stumped and reaching out here for some help. i recently took over complete management of the network at my work after the network architect left for a new job. before that i was just a lowly network engineer mostly just fixing broken switches and enduser networking related issues, building issues etc. i am new to the aruba clearpass environment. we have three wireless ssids one uses ad credentials for authentication, one uses wpa2 passphrase, and the other uses a captive portal and is open. think business, iot devices, and public. public is on its own vlan and should be isolated from everything else and only have access to the internet. the issue is i noticed recently that when connected to public i can reach some infrastructure on certain vlans. my question is inside of clearpass when you are looking at the roles and role mappings i see a guest role and it is properly mapped to the public ssid but i dont see how to limit its inter vlan traffic anywhere. i did see how to limit inter vlan traffic in our aruba mobility manager but that was only in the firewall section and seemed to be global to all the ssids. the issue is that i need the other two ssids to allow inter vlan traffic but block public from inter vlan traffic. i was hoping to do this inside clearpass or mobility master. if there are any aruba wifi or clearpass experts i would greatly appreciate some help in understanding how to adjust the settings on a role or if there is a way to stop inter vlan traffic on a singular ssid but not the others. thanks in advance. || do you understand how the aos system and clearpass work together? clearpass is just the radius authentication system, all networking set up should be done on the aos system. when authenticating, the device connecting to wireless will connect to the ssid and what is called a default role, which if they dont meet the criteria of the service of the ssid they get stuck in that default role and it should give the no access to minimal access. if it meets the criteria within the service of the ssid in clearpass, its role is flipped from default to whatever criteria it met, then that new role would be made aware by the aos system. so you would need to make the change on the aos system. if lets say guest is 10.130.0.016, iot is 10.160.0.016 and business is 10.190.0.016 lets say now you didnt want guest and business to talk, on business role you would add any source to 10.130.0.016 deny and then you would add the same to guest any source to 10.190.0.016 deny hopefully what i said makes sense. || i should add i see a profile called limited access and i see a role called guest in clearpass but i dont see where the actual values of those are controlled beyond their names. || 1. you need to define user roles on the wireless controller. 2. you need to assign firewall policies to the user roles. 3. you need to assign those roles to the role derivation policy in clearpass. unfortunately i cant link to jack squat because the aruba links have gone dead in the transition to hpes site, but youre looking for roles and firewall rules for aruba mobility controllers and role assignments and derivation in clearpass."
how to diagnose network issues,"hi everyone, im working on a pxe deployment project and joined midstream, so im trying to catch up. were using pxe to image new laptops, but were encountering issues where the boot process gets stuck at start pxe over ipv4. heres our setup 3 pxe servers we have three servers dedicated to pxe imaging. ip helpers were using ip helpers to direct pxe requests to these servers, rather than dhcp options. dhcp functionality ive confirmed via packet capture that dhcp is working correctly. the local service desk reports that laptops consistently halt at the start pxe over ipv4 stage. this suggests a problem beyond basic dhcp. my challenge i need to isolate whether the issue is networkrelated, specifically regarding the ip helpers and pxe server communication. direct wireshark captures on the server side are currently not feasible. questions 1. what network tests can i perform to validate the ip helper configuration and ensure proper communication between the laptop and the pxe servers? 2. are there any specific tools or techniques i can use to diagnose pxerelated network issues without serverside captures? 3. given that were using ip helpers instead of dhcp options, are there any common pitfalls or configuration checks i should focus on? 4. what type of information should i ask the local service desk to gather, that will help me narrow down the problem? any tips or guidance would be greatly appreciated! thanks in advance. || are the ports on the switches getting in the right vlan? when we had to deploy pxe boot machines we ended up pulling cisco ise off the ports so they wouldnt get blocked || have you confirmed the biosfw in use on the laptops supports dhcp relay? some of them are dumb and anything other than the most basic setup is too much for them. can you get a mirrorspan port on a switch somewhere you could run wireshark on? || theres no such thing as a pxe server. pxe is not a network service. pxe is a process which runs on the client device. it requires a variety of services from the network, probably dhcp, dns, tftp and precisely what is required to make it work will depend on the devices youre trying to boot. some examples most clients expect to collect their boot file via tftp with the location specified in the siaddr server nameip and file path to file dhcp options, but some will accept a url via the file option. some clients cant seem to do dns lookups, so the servers must be specified by ip address. i recently worked with some clients which absolutely ignored the siadder next server option, choosing instead to try to receive the boot file from the dhcp server. i cant imagine solving this problem without packet capture at the client and also at the servers."
how to diagnose network issues,"we have at least 14 of them. i have no idea how we have not gotten any issues with looping at all. the problem is that so much of the wiring in this building was set up for voice and not data. it looks like my next task will be to convince my boss that it is important to get rid of those because they are a risk to us. any tips on how i can convince him? he will probably agree, but i would rather come in prepared. i should be able to explain how it is possible to take down the entire network and that we will be unable to see what is on the network with those unmanaged switches. || im going to go on a limb based on your username that youre new to the career and this will be a great opportunity for you to learn the impact of our role in the business. i have a very high suspicion that your request will be denied, not because its a poor design, or the risk, but simply due to the cost. i dont think youll be able to get rid of these either, you may have the opportunity to swap in managed switches in their place but even that is a tough ask though admittedly cheaper. lets just say your 14 managed switches are all four ports minimum that means you have 56 ports you now need to buy for whatever stackchassis you operate. hopefully theyre all in the same rack, but probably not. this means ports are spread out everywhere and where you already likely have limited space. on top of that, you start getting into structure cabling. even during the day youre looking at probably 35k just to install the lines to make up for all of those unmanaged switches. its all spitballing but be aware these costs are real and can dampen any good intention you have. very few companies have funds to do a project like this without having it been planned to go into a capex budget for the year. i noted you might be able to get small managed replacement switches. this is probably the best best, though depending on your primary vendor could still be costly. i know aruba makes quite a few nice desktop managed switches that you could use and are around 1000 each estimate! i know theyre probably cheaper. that puts you at only needing to spend 14k. so, i dont say this to shoot down your idea or dissuade you from talking to your boss but look at the figures and stats i provided. theyre rough for sure, but once you start talking to vendors youll see something similar. youll want to have a full accounting and understanding of the costs. you likely have a preferred vendors, reach out to them for quotes based on everything i noted. keep in mind that many businesses dont want structured cabling being done during the day so youre almost immediately paying a premium for eveningovertime work. you can also point to the risks but be realistic how often are devices plugged in and out of these switches? can you point to any slowness? what is the business value of letting it just sit there versus a risk of a loop? youve just entered, i think, the most fun aspect of networking. we are constantly playing the game of balance risk, reward, cost, and effort. these unmanaged switches would be roundly denounced across the board here... but we all have them. they serve a purpose for the business, they get people working at low cost. the last thing i would add here, document all of this. everything. when an issue does come up, you have the details ready. this will save your butt in the future when it does cause a problem and give you support to convince the power that be later that the investment is necessary. lastly, dont hate the last guy. there are often reasons why things like this exist, whether its poor planning, poor policy enforcement, or just an old ass shitty building. were stuck in the sandbox that has been built around us and we do the best with what we got. i hope this works out for you though, builds of any size are fun. even if its just a couple switches in the closet. good luck! || are you talking 45 port switches or 2448 port switches? 4 port switches are just a fact of life. no one wants to pay to run new ethernet drops when a 20 switch will address the issue. if you are talking about needing vlans, thats another thing. back when managed switches were super expensive, it was common to have one main managed switch and plug multiple 24 ports unmanaged switches or hubs into that. iirc, someone could take down a floor, but not the whole building. but anyway, the argument you need to make is that the money spent on managed switches provides more realworld security, or necessary regulatory compliance, on demonstrable uptimebusiness continuity than that same money spent elsewhere. how does this investment benefit the business more than a better backup solution of better ransomware protection? || having an unmanaged switch at an engineers desk where he has 34 workstations or other devices plugged in is not a risk to anything. having random switches strung out between desks to get them connected is a risk. figure out which situation youre in, and address accordingly. also, if you arent using 802.1x, then unmanaged switches arent a security risk at all. they are at most an availability risk. and if you think he needs convincing that a loop could cause a broadcast storm, send out an email or im broadcast telling everybody to expect a brief outage during the meeting, identify a good pair of switches, and plug a cable in. give it 23 minutes, then unplug it again when things stop working. lastly, you probably do want to upgrade the company to proper structured cabling with one mdf and probably 2 idf from the sounds of things, to make sure you dont have random switches dangling in the ceiling to connect random clusters of cubicles, and make sure it knows which engineers have unmanaged switches at their desks and catalogs and inventories them, so that they can be reclaimed when not needed and upgraded when they die or age out . and so you know they really are properly unmanaged."
how to diagnose network issues,"this is a soho with multiple devices on a 10g eth backbone, so i hope it doesnt qualify as home networking, although many devices are consumeradjacent, like the ones i am having issues with i am posing on cisco, but it looks like its an issue that can maybe be solved by setting some dhcp option of some sort, or at least having a different perspective on the issue itself. hello, i never resorted to asking for help on networking, much less on cisco, where everything is usually working, and if its not, its usually your fault... but... i have a router assigning dhcp on a simple 24 network. i have two different wifi providers i can use one is the router itself which can act as an access point, the other provider is multiple cisco 150ax devices. this behavior happens seldomly when roaming between 150axs, but it happens every time a client roams or even just maually changes ap from the builtin router wlan to the cisco 150ax published one. i used this failure reliability to narrow down the issue. what is the issue? the client cannot get a dhcp response when switching to a 150ax ap. i tried logs at all different levels, i also tried android debugging the wifi stack, but it always comes down to the ap doing some sort of fun stuff behind the scenes, and i also saw a log which i dont have a screenshot of, dumb me, and cant recall how to reproduce of the 150ax thinking that the mac address authenticating to it, is askingobtainingrequesting an ip address that is impossible to be real, because the client is connected elsewhere, and thus has to be forged. this results in the client not receiving a dhcp response on the air, and deauthenticating after a few seconds, due to timeout. the client works fine if reconnecting to the router ap, and works fine if, after some time looks like 5 minutes of no connectivity has not to connect to the router ap tries to connect back to the cisco 150ax published network. looks a lot like some sort of security lockout. what i have tried different dhcp servers different client devices oss even happens with some google home unit and also woth the damn washing machine different network authentication methods including open different wlan asides different 150ax units firmware upgradedowngrade adding the device mac address to the local users 2.4g or 5g, in different bands, with different channel widths all roaming related options onoffmixed rf optimizationsdetections onoffmixed dhcphttp profiling onoff if a client is known on the network, it wont allow it to connect to the ciscopublished wireless network. i also have found no option to disable any kind of dhcp snooping andor inspection, which would solve my problem, since its a soho setup, and i dont need the added security. when it works, its flawless, with 1200mbps peak speeds, and all the bells and whistles. when it doesnt, its 5 minutes lockout, and i am keeping a backup ssid on the router active, so that i can connect... but how can a 50 shitty provider wireless router have less problem than a socalled business device? ahhhh i miss linksys 54gs thanks in advance to whomever could help with this. its driving me mad, and thinking of throwing away hundreds of dollars of hardware its several 150axs and switching to something dumber. || "
