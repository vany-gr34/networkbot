4Wireless Security Checklist Linksys WES610N/WET610N 4Wireless networks are convenient and easy to install, so homes with highspeed Internet access are adopting them at a rapid pace Because wireless networking operates by sending information over radio waves, it can be more vulnerable to intruders than a traditional wired network Like signals from your cellular or cordless phones, signals from your wireless network can also be intercepted Since you cannot physically prevent someone from connecting to your wireless network, you need to take some additional steps to keep your network secure Change the default wireless network name or SSID Wireless devices have a default wireless network name or Service Set Identifier (SSID) set by the factory This is the name of your wireless network, and can be up to 32 characters in length Linksys wireless products use linksys as the default wireless network name You should change the wireless network name to something unique to distinguish your wireless network from other wireless networks that may exist around you, but do not use personal information (such as your Social Security number) because this information may be available for anyone to see when browsing for wireless networks Change the default password For wireless products such as access points and routers, you will be asked for a password when you want to change their settings These devices have a default password set by the factory The Linksys default password is admin Hackers know these defaults and may try to use them to access your wireless device and change your network settings To thwart any unauthorized changes, customize the device’s password so it will be hard to guess Enable MAC address filtering Linksys routers give you the ability to enable Media Access Control (MAC) address filtering The MAC address is a unique series of numbers and letters assigned to every networking device With MAC address filtering enabled, wireless network access is provided solely for wireless devices with specific MAC addresses For example, you can specify the MAC address of each computer in your home so that only those computers can access your wireless network Enable encryption Encryption protects data transmitted over a wireless network Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA/WPA2) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) offer different levels of security for wireless communication A network encrypted with WPA/WPA2 is more secure than a network encrypted with WEP, because WPA/WPA2 uses dynamic key encryption To protect the information as it passes over the airwaves, you should enable the highest level of encryption supported by your network equipment WEP is an older encryption standard and may be the only option available on some older devices that do not support WPA General Network Security Guidelines Wireless network security is useless if the underlying network is not secure 
- Password protect all computers on the network and individually password protect sensitive files 
- Change passwords on a regular basis 
- Install anti-virus software and personal firewall software 
- Disable file sharing (peer-to-peer) Some applications may open file sharing without your consent and/or knowledge Wireless Security Checklist
5Wireless Security Checklist Linksys WES610N/WET610N Additional Security Tips 
- Keep wireless routers, access points, or gateways away from exterior walls and windows 
- Turn wireless routers, access points, or gateways off when they are not being used (at night, during vacations) 
- Use strong passphrases that are at least eight characters in length Combine letters and numbers to avoid using standard words that can be found in the dictionary 
6Advanced Configuration Linksys WES610N/WET610N 6After setting up the bridge by following the steps on the CD folder, the bridge will be ready for use However, if you want to change its advanced settings, use the bridge’s browser-based utility This chapter describes each web page of the utility and each page’s key functions You can access the utility via a web browser on a computer networked with the bridge The browser-based utility has these main tabs: Setup, Wireless, Administration, and Status Additional tabs will be available after you click one of the main tabs How to access the browser-based utility Use a web browser to access the browser-based utility If the bridge is connected to a network with a DHCP server (usually the network router), then the bridge will obtain its IP address from the DHCP server If there is no DHCP server, then the bridge will use its default static IP address, 169.254.1.250 (If you set a permanent static IP address on the bridge through the browser-based utility, then enter the static IP address instead ) NOTE If you do not know the bridge’s IP address, then find its IP address in the DHCP clients table of your router (Refer to the documentation for your router ) If you cannot locate the bridge’s IP address, you can reset the bridge; press the Reset button on the bridge for approximately five seconds, using a straightened paper clip This will reset the bridge back to the factory default settings The bridge will request an IP address from the DHCP server (usually the network router) If no DHCP server is found, then the bridge will use its default static IP address, 169.254.1.250, until it detects a DHCP server and is assigned a dynamic IP address If the bridge is not associated with a router and is using the factory default settings, connect a computer to the bridge using an Ethernet connection to access the web -based utility You will need to configure the Ethernet connection on the computer with a static IP address and subnet mask The IP address of your Ethernet adapter should be set to a specific IP address 1. In the IP address field, enter 169.254.x.y (x should be replaced by a number between 1 and 254, and y should be replaced by a number between 0 and 255) 2. In the Subnet mask field, enter 255.255.0.0 NOTE The steps to assign a static IP address to the Ethernet adapter on your computer vary by operating system For instructions, please refer to the help documentation of your specific operating system After you have assigned your Ethernet adapter with a static IP address, launch your web browser, and enter the Adapter’s IP address (the default setting is 169.254.1.250)in the Address field Press Enter A password request screen appears (Non-Windows XP users will see a similar screen ) Leave the User name field blank Enter the password you created during the Setup Wizard If you did not create a new password, use the default password admin (You can set a new password from the Administration > Management screen ) Click OK to continue NOTE If the password request screen does not appear, wait two minutes and try again Advanced Configuration
