 1Fiber Optic Infrastructure Application Guide ENET-TD003C-EN-PDeploying a Fiber Optic Physical Infrastructure within a Converged Plantwide Ethernet Architecture Introduction Converged Plantwide Ethernet (CPwE) is the underlying architecture that provides standard network services for control and information disciplines, devices, and equipment found in modern industrial automation and control system (IACS) applications. CPwE is a collection of tested an d validated architectures that are developed by subject matter authorities at Cisco, Panduit 1, and Rockwell Automation that follow the Cisco Validated Design (CVD) program. The content of CPwE, which is relevant to both Operational Technology (OT) and Informational Technology (IT) disciplines, c onsists of documented architectures, best practices, guidance, and configuration settings to help manufacturer s with design and deployment of a scalable, reliable, secure, and future-ready plant-wide industrial ne twork infrastructure. Connections within a CPwE architecture take many forms includi ng copper cabling, fiber optic cabling, and wireless connectivity. This application guide provides direction for the fiber optic cabling used in a CPwE architecture. As a data transport medium, optical fiber is an integral part of a CPwE deployment. Fiber provides the connectivity for a wide variety of connection types and offers several benefits w ithin a CPwE architecture. By bringing the CPwE architecture to market, Cisco and Rockwell Automation help manufacturers meet the challenges of a fully-integrated IACS and realize the bu siness benefits standard networking offers. CPwE can also help manufacturers achieve the be nefits of cost reduction using proven designs that facilitate quicker deployment while helping to reduce risk in deploying new technology. Figure 1 shows the CPwE logical framewor k, which incorporates all elemen ts of a standard plant-wide network. The CPwE logical framework segments devices and equipmen t into hierarchical functions. This framework also identifies Levels of operations and defines logical plant network Zoning (segmentation) based on functional and security areas. In this document, the CPwE term Industrial Zone is used generically to represent applications such as IACS, process auto mation systems (PAS), and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA). This appli cation guide can be viewed as an extension to the CPwE Deploying a Resilient Converged Plantwide Ethernet Architecture Design and Implementation Guide (http://literature.rockwellautomation.com/idc/gro ups/literature/documents/td/enet-td010_-en-p.pdf ). Plant-wide deployment of EtherNet/IPTM requires an industrial network design methodology, which helps create a structured hierarchy to support real-time netw ork performance. In addition, it helps enable the convergence of multiple control and information disciplines, including data collection, configuration, 1. This fiber application guide.

Figure 1 CPwE Logical Framework What You Will Learn This application guide helps designers and installers select and deploy fiber optic media in plant environments. It details fiber optic network infras tructure solutions that provide high-performance connectivity options that help increase the integrity and availabilit y of a CPwE architect ure at each level of the plant-wide network. To assist designers and installers with planning and implementing a viable network infrastructure, this application guide focuses on the following three steps for selecting fiber optic cabling: 1. Determine the correct type of singlemode or multimode and, if multimode fiber is required, the correct grade of multimode fiber. 2. Determine the number of fiber optic strands needed in each cable run. 3. Select the appropriate cable construction for the environment. In addition to cable selection, this application guide discusses the connector s, adapters, and patching required for a structured cable deployment. It also explains selection and be st practice applications for cable management, pathways, and fiber optic enclosures. 
 3Fiber Optic Infrastructure Application Guide ENET-TD003C-EN-P Deploying a Fiber Optic Physical Infrastructu re within a Converged Plantwide Ethernet Architecture Fiber Optic Cabling Systems Overview Fiber Optic Cabling Systems Overview A fiber optic network generally comprises multiple pieces of equipment interconnected by optical fiber cabling assemblies. The fiber channel is the fiber opt ic connection between one piece of equipment and another and includes the entire fiber a ssembly. Each channel consists of a pair of fibers that form an individual circuit, with each circuit having a tran smit fiber (typically labeled TX) a nd a receive fiber (typically labeled RX). When configured this way, the optical fiber assemblies in this channel become a duplex type supporting separate transmit and receive circuits. The CPwE architectures subject matte r authorities recommend the use of optical fiber links between network switches in the Industrial Zone for the following applications: 
- Redundant paths for high availability— ring and redundant star Optimal resiliency protocol convergence times for switches Electromagnetic noise immunity Distance and outdoor cable runs Figure 2 LC Duplex Patch Cord Various approaches can be used to configure the channel. For ex ample, a duplex patch cord ( Figure 2 ) may be used to connect two pieces of equi pment that are in close proximity to each other. Attention must be given to achieve the correct polarization of the connections, i.e., that the transm it (TX) port of one device attaches to the receive (RX) port of the other piece of equipm ent and vice versa. This polarization is accomplished by patch cord construction and standardized keying of the connectors.

The adapters are mounted into patch panels or other types of mounting arrangements that provide a mechanically c onvenient and secure po int for the connection. Optical fiber systems deployed in local area network (LAN) applications do not use the same fiber for transmit and receive, which means that the transmit port of one piece of eq uipment must be connected to the receive port of the neighbor—commonly known as A to B. The A to B connection must be made in the permanent link and patch cords to confirm correct operation, as shown in Figure 3. This section discusses the available options and sel ection and installation considerations for fiber optic cabling systems, which include: Selecting Singlemode or Multimode Fiber Selecting the Number of Fiber Optic Cabling Strands Environmental Cable Designs Fiber Connectors Network Convergence Time Fiber Optic Loss/Power Budgets Fiber Cable Management Media Selection: –Cell/Area Zone Fiber Optic Cabling Types –Industrial Distribution Frame Fiber Optic Cabling Types and Products –Level 3 Site Operations Fiber Optic Cabling Types –Patch Cords 
 5Fiber Optic Infrastructu re Application Guide ENET-TD003C-EN-P Deploying a Fiber Optic Physical Infrastruct ure within a Converged Plan twide Ethernet Architecture Fiber Optic Cabling Systems Overview Selecting Singlemode or Multimode Fiber There are two different types of fiber used in connecting networks, singlemode and multimode, which vary by glass core size and by the design and operation of the transceivers used. Multimode fiber is commonly used for shorter transmission distances due to the cost efficiency it offers. Singlemode fiber uses more precise transceivers to achieve longer transm ission distances and is more costly to implement than multimode fiber. Designers and installers need to make sure that the tr ansceiver type and fiber type are compatible for optimal performance. Multimode optical fiber incorporates a larger core diamet er than singlemode fiber type. In addition, the core diameter used in multimode fiber varies depending upon the performa nce type used. For example, OM1 (optical multimode 1) was the first type of multimode fiber to be deployed and uses a 62.5µm core diameter with an overall cladding diameter of 125µm. This fiber type is almost never deployed in new installations, but may be required for legacy installations with an installed equipment base. Multimode fiber types OM2, OM3, and OM4 are based on the use of a core diameter of 50µm (again with a cladding diameter of 125µm) and offer improved performance in terms of maximum channel length. OM4 is recommended for new installations and represents the best available compromise between total link cost (optical fiber plus transceivers) and channel length. Singlemode fiber types used in plant network applications have a core diameter of 9µm and a cladding diameter of 125µm. The transceivers used with singlemode fiber incorpor ate more costly laser sources and so the overall link cost is higher than multimode fiber, however longer channel leng ths can be realized. There are two common designations for optical singlemode (OS) fiber, identified as OS1 and OS2. OS1 is a legacy fiber type and is not recommended for any deployment, though it may be seen in legacy deployments. OS2 is the default singlemode fiber designation, though literature commonly calls this OS1/OS2. Figure 4 shows a schematic diagram of the different optical fiber constructions and the designations for each fiber type are listed in Table 1.

Commonly used counts include 2, 6, 12, 24, and 36 strands. The number of strands required for an optimal deployment equates to the number of pairs required for switches and devices that must be connected and includ es a factor for growth. For example, conn ecting three access switches in close prox imity to a distribution switch in a different location requires six strands because each acces s switch requires two st rands for transmit and receive. Additional strands shou ld be included for future growth and th e possibility of failed fiber strands. To determine the total number of strands, combine the required strands, future growth, and spares. For this example, a twelve-strand fibe r cable is the proper choice. Environmental Fiber optic cabling in IACS envir onments can encounter caustic, wet, vibrating, and electrical noise conditions. Therefore during physical layer design, de signers should assess these environmental factors in each area where the network is to be distributed ( Figure 5 ). 
 7Fiber Optic Infrastructu re Application Guide ENET-TD003C-EN-P Deploying a Fiber Optic Physical Infrastruct ure within a Converged Plan twide Ethernet Architecture Fiber Optic Cabling Systems Overview Figure 5 Sample Environmental An alysis Using the MICE System The Mechanical, Ingress, Chemical/Cl imatic, and Electromagnetic (MICE) sy stem is an assessment tool that evaluates these specified risk factor s in each zone of a generic cable pl ant. MICE diagramming allows the design to balance component costs with mitigation costs to build a robust yet cost-effective system. Each MICE factor is graded on a severity scale ranging from 1-3. MICE criteria allo w the designer to select appropriate media (such as armored fiber) or protec tive pathway arrangements th at avoid risks from the environment affecting performance or reliability. Qualif ying the exposure levels allows designers to specify appropriate connectivity and pathways to enable longterm performance. For exam ple, exposure to shock, vibration, or ultraviolet (UV) light may require use of armored fiber cabling suitable for outdoor environments. For this assessment, consider using MICE analysis, a method recommended by global standards groups such as ANSI/TIA-568-D.0 and ODV A, Inc. EtherNet/IP Media Planning & Installation Manual (https://www.odva.org/Portals/0/Library/Publicati ons_Numbered/PUB00148R0_EtherNetIP_Media_Planni ng_and_Installation_Manual.pdf ).. A tutorial on this analytic tool is found in TIA TSB-185 - Environmental Clas sification (MICE) Tutorial. Cable Designs This section discusses the four basic fiber optic cable designs for plant-wide network applications: Indoor Distribution

Reading from left to right, the various fiber selections increase in environmental severity. Table 2 Fiber Types with Details Fiber Application Although there are many types and constructions of opti cal fiber, this discussion focuses on Industrial Zone applications where there are four main fiber types that are commonly deployed in IACS networks. These fiber types can vary greatly depending on the type of deploy ment, design concerns, envi ronment in the Industrial Zone, etc. They are identified acco rding to typical areas of use: Indoor Distribution—Typically used in the Enterprise Zone and suitable points in the Industrial Zone, e.g., to the Level 3 Site Operations Industrial Data Center (IDC). Armored Distribution—A variation of the cabling type in Indoor Distribution, it is used in Industrial Zone areas where continuous pathwa ys are not available and is de sirable since the armored cable provides protection normally obtained by routing in co ntinuous pathways. This fiber type will typically be routed from the IDC to the Physical Network Zone System (PNZS) or the IACS control panels. Dielectric Conduited Fiber (DCF)—An attractive option when using a smaller number of fibers that might be seen closer to the PNZS or control panel in the Industrial Zone and is used in situations similar to Armored Distribution. A more detailed description of DCF is in Industrial Distri bution Frame Fiber Optic Cabling Types and Products. 9Fiber Optic Infrastructu re Application Guide ENET-TD003C-EN-P Deploying a Fiber Optic Physical Infrastruct ure within a Converged Plan twide Ethernet Architecture Fiber Optic Cabling Systems Overview Table 3 gives additional selection information for the diff erent fiber types within IACS network deployments. Fiber Construction for Indoor or Outdoor Use The most common construction for optical fiber for indoor use is called tight buffer, where a protective coating surrounds the cladding and an additional jacket of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) brings the diameter of the individual fiber to 900µm. Multiple fibers are wra pped with a protective Aramid yarn. The entire cable assembly is coated in a durable extern al jacket, typically polymer material, that is riser, plenum, or otherwise rated to suit the installation environment. Tight buffered fiber is not deploye d in outdoor environments because the temperature extremes and mechanical stresses encountered in outdoor installations can cause physical degradation or even damage to the fiber. An alternate construction, loose tube, is us ed for fiber deployments in outdoor environments. The loose tube design consists of the individual fibers (bef ore the PVC coating is applie d) which “float” within a polymer tube allowing it to move yet be protected when the fiber is subject to movement. Older cable designs also use a water blocking gel inserted into the tube to help protect the fiber from both damage and moisture ingress. Newer indoor/outdoor cable types include a water absorptive tape underneath the exterior jacket that swells and forms an effective s eal if the jacket is ruptured. Examples of the construction of the tight buff ered and loose tube fiber types are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7 .Table 3 Selection Information for Fiber Types within IACS Network Deployments Indoor Distribution Metal Armored Distribution Dielectric Conduited Fiber Most frequent area of use With in the Enterprise Zone and Level 3 Site OperationsTypical light Industrial Zone environment pathways using J-hooks or other non-continuous approachesTypical light Industrial Zone environment pathways using J-hooks or other non-continuous approaches Most typical level of use in CPwE architecture3, 4, 5 Connections between 3 and 2, Cell/Area ZoneConnection between 3 and 2, Cell/Area Zone Mode types OS2, OM1-OM4 OS2, OM1-OM4 OS2, OM1-OM4Typical range of individual fibers2-144 2-144 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 Support required?

 11Fiber Optic Infrastructu re Application Guide ENET-TD003C-EN-P Deploying a Fiber Optic Physical Infrastruct ure within a Converged Plan twide Ethernet Architecture Fiber Optic Cabling Systems Overview Figure 7 Loose Tube Fiber Type Distribution Fi ber Optic Cabli ng (Non-armored) Non-armored distribution fiber optic cabling ( Figure 8 ) is a standard cable that ru ns in a cabling basket, cable ladder, or conduit in an indoor environment. Non-armore d distribution fiber optic cabling requires protection, therefore, at a minimum, it should be installed in a duct or continuously supported system depending on the environment. It may also require greater environm ental hardening depending on the harshness of the environment (e.g., in conduit). This cabling type is used in the intra-building backbon e, building backbone, and horizontal installations for riser (OFNR), plenum (OFNP), and ge neral-purpose environments. Riser and plenum-rated fiber optic cable are most commonly used in North Am erica. Other regions of the world, (e.g., Europe and Asia Pacific) require optical fiber with a low smoke zero halogen (LSZ H) rated cable jacket. Always consult the local codes and standards for the plant location to be certain the prop er variant is selected duri ng the design stage. This topic is discussed in more detail in Level 3 Site Operations Fiber Optic Cabling Types. 12Fiber Optic Infrastructure Application Guide ENET-TD003C-EN-P Deploying a Fiber Optic Physical Infrastructu re within a Converged Plantwide Ethernet Architecture Fiber Optic Cabling Systems Overview Figure 8 Distribution Fiber Op tic Cabling (Non-Armored) Figure 9 IP-rated OSP/IO Fiber Optic Cabling IP-rated (Outside Pl ant/Indoor and Outdoor) Fiber Optic Cabling IP-rated fiber optic cabling (outside plant/indoor and out door) is rated for high temperatures, is chemically resistant, and can be used in harsh environments ( Figure 9 ). These fiber cables incorporate loose tube construction making them suitable for aerial, duct, an d direct burial applications. There are two types of 
 13Fiber Optic Infrastructu re Application Guide ENET-TD003C-EN-P Deploying a Fiber Optic Physical Infrastruct ure within a Converged Plan twide Ethernet Architecture Fiber Optic Cabling Systems Overview ingress protection: gel and gel-free. Although the gel help s to protect the fibers and prevent moisture ingress, it becomes sticky and messy when handled. Gel-free designs are easier to handle and have tape that swells in contact with water to provide dry water blocking. A corrugated steel armoring over the polymer jacket pr otecting the fibers provides high crush resistance for increased durability in di rect burial appl ications. A UV resistant cable sh eathing is often used in these applications to protect the individual fiber cable. As in the case of the indoor cable described above, outside plant/indoor and outdoor cable is available in 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 144-fiber counts. This cable construction also supports multimode (OM4, OM3, OM2, and OM1) and singlemode (OS2) fiber types. Interlocking Armored Fiber Optic Cabling Interlocking armored fiber optic cabling (both indoor and outside the plant) has a protective aluminum or metal housing around the fiber cable to provide superior crush resistance and guar d the cabling from animal intrusion ( Figure 10 ). Aluminum interlocking armor also eliminates the need for inner duct or conduit with a smaller pathway for improved design flexibility and lowe r installed cost. In addition, these cables permit easy retrofit into existing industrial environments, removing the need for sophisticated and expensive pathways. Armored fiber optic cabling types are used in the intra-building backbone, building backbone, and horizontal installations for riser (OFCR), plenum (OFCP), and ha rsh environments. The cables are available in 6, 12, and 24-fiber counts in a “single ja cket” design and in 36, 48, 72, 96, and 144-fiber counts in a “subunit” (group) design. For higher fiber count types, depending upon the construction, subunits of fibers are housed within internal jackets inside the overall cable jacket to facilitate identification and installation. Multimode (OM4, OM3, OM2, and OM1) and singlemode (OS2) fiber are widely available.
 14Fiber Optic Infrastructure Application Guide ENET-TD003C-EN-P Deploying a Fiber Optic Physical Infrastructu re within a Converged Plantwide Ethernet Architecture Fiber Optic Cabling Systems Overview Figure 10 Armored Fiber Optic Cabling Fiber Connectors Connectors are the physical interfac e between the cabling and networked de vices. There are several connector types used in the network physical infrastructure. This section discusses thr ee connector types commonly encountered when fiber optic cable is used in industrial networks: Lucent (LC) Subscriber (SC) Straight Tip (ST) The characteristics of the three co nnector types are summarized in Table 4. LC Connectors LC connectors are used in data center environments and many IACS devices. They have a small footprint that allows them to be used on high port count switches and on devices, minimizing the space required to land these connections. The LC connector fo otprint is approximately half the size of an SC connector and has a back shell designed to accommodate standard 1.6mm to 3.0mm diameter cable designs. The LC connector interface presents a small form-factor pluggable (S FP) demountable interfa ce for connection to SFP transceivers. The standard construction of the LC conn ector consists of a spring-loaded, 1.25mm diameter

The dimensions for this connector are defined in both domestic (TIA-604 FOCIS-10) and international (IEC 61754-20) standards. Of the three connector types identified in this sec tion, the LC connector is most used due to its high performance and small size, allowing the highest connection densities to be obtained. SC Connectors SC connectors are snap-in connectors th at are widely used in singlemode fiber optic cabling systems. These connectors are used in the data communication and telecommunication industries but are losing ground to LC and other connector types. One reason is their larger size, which prevents them from being used in high-density applications. Despite this limitation, SC connectors have a strong presence in the enterprise market where high density is not an issue. ST Connectors ST connectors are bayonet style conn ectors that create secure multimode connections. The ST connector is used for inline connections, however some equipment uses ST connectors b ecause of the mechanical stability of the connection.

 16Fiber Optic Infrastructure Application Guide ENET-TD003C-EN-P Deploying a Fiber Optic Physical Infrastructu re within a Converged Plantwide Ethernet Architecture Fiber Optic Cabling Systems Overview Note The ODV A, Inc. EtherNet/IP specificatio n for the physical layer () states that the LC connector is preferred for new installations requ iring 100 Mbps data rates, though SC and ST connector types are supported. It also states that the LC connector is preferred for new installations requiring 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps) data rates, though SC connector types are allowable for legacy installations. Horizontal Cable Fiber Connector Termination Fiber cable is attached to connectors using a variety of methods. Decisi on criteria are ease of installation, cost, and performance. The three main methods are: Fusion splice onto a fiber pigtail Field application of epoxy and field polish No epoxy, no polish Fusion Splicing For this approach, the connector is f actory terminated onto a short length of the same fiber type that is used in the field cabling, forming an assembly called a pigtail. The optical fiber to be terminated is prepared on site and, along with the free end of the pigtail fiber, it is placed into a pi ece of equipment known as a fusion splicer that contains a heating elem ent. The silica is melted to solidify and fuse the fibers together to make a very reliable and high performing fiber joint. A protective spli ce tube is placed over the area of the joint and tube loaded into a splice tray holder that provides mechanical protection for the jo int. The splice tray is frequently a 19-inch rack mounted unit that can be conveniently accessed should moves, adds, and changes (MACs) be necessary. The splice tray usually incorporates slack s pools onto which the excess fiber can be routed for good cable management and protection. Field Application of Epoxy and Polish For this method, the fi ber to be terminated in place is prepared, fed into the requi red connector, and extended through the front face of the connector. An epoxy is loaded in to an aperture in the connector and cured to firmly fix the fiber into the connector. Excess fiber is remove d from the connector front face and field polished with a grinding puck and paste to form a reliab le interface. The front end of the fiber is inspected using a small microscope called a bo rescope to achieve a high connecti on performance. The connector can be loaded into a fiber adap ter that is located in a fi ber enclosure. The excess buffe red individual fibers are managed on slack spools in the enclosure. No Epoxy, No Polish More recently, termination t echniques that use connectors already loaded with a shor t length of optical fiber and factory prepared with high accuracy faces have been introduced. The connector includes a gel to achieve lowest attenuation between the pre-lo aded and installed fiber. The fiber to be terminated is prepared by stripping off the buffer and cut using a special cleaver that resu lts in a clean fiber end. The fiber is installed into the rear of the connector and locates against the rear of the pre-in stalled fiber length. At the correct point in the termination procedure, a cam on the connector is rotated to lock the installed fiber into place. In modern termination tools, such as the Panduit OptiCam™ tool shown in Figure 11, an internal light source (the visual fault locator) shows the performance of the connection just made. An eff ective termination has been created if little or no light can be seen through a window in the connector.
 17Fiber Optic Infrastructu re Application Guide ENET-TD003C-EN-P Deploying a Fiber Optic Physical Infrastruct ure within a Converged Plan twide Ethernet Architecture Fiber Optic Cabling Systems Overview Figure 11 Panduit OptiCam Tool The terminated fiber is installed into a fiber adapter and managed in the same way as the field epoxy, field polish connector scheme described above. Note To help achieve worker and equipment safety, it is impor tant to adhere to proper procedures when handling fiber optic cabling. For more information on fiber optic cable handling and safety, refer to Appendix A, “Fiber Optic Cable Handling and Safety.” Network Convergence Time Network convergence time measures how long it takes to recover from both link loss and industrial Ethernet switch (IES) power disruption. For resilient network link loss (e.g., a Resilient Ethernet Protocol [REP] ring), the convergence time (i.e., healing, recovery, etc.) meas ures how long it takes to detect a fault, find an alternate path, and forward network tr affic across that alternate path. Indu stry experts agree that fiber optic cabling provides ideal network convergence times in ring topologies. For IES disruptions (e.g., power loss) in resilient networks, convergence time measures how long it takes to detect the loss of the IES and reconfigure operational IES forwarding tables to work around the loss of an IES. During the network convergence tim e, the network drops traffic becau se interconnectivity has been interrupted. If the convergence time is longer than the Allen-Bradley ® Programmable Automation Controller (PAC) connection timeout, the PAC may temporarily drop its connection to its EtherNet/IP devices which may result in downtime and lost production. Note Network convergence times vary based on the IES platform, resiliency protocol, and port type. 
 18Fiber Optic Infrastructure Application Guide ENET-TD003C-EN-P Deploying a Fiber Optic Physical Infrastructu re within a Converged Plantwide Ethernet Architecture Fiber Optic Cabling Systems Overview Fiber Optic Loss/Power Budgets It is critical to verify th at the transmitted optical signal has suffic ient power when it r eaches the receiver and the receiver has adequate sens itivity to decode the optical signal. The first step of the verification process is calculating the optical loss and power budgets to dete rmine whether the design and deployment meet IEEE 802.3 specifications. Th is calculation is known as the overall power budget for an optical channel link and is determined using an optic loss budget calculation based on the IEEE 802.3 standard. The standard considers the combination of transceiver technology and the fiber cabling type and connectors. Signal loss, termed attenuation, occurs in the cable itself, mated connectors, splices, splitters, and other optical components as shown in Figure 12. The optical power loss of components and cabling is found in their respective specifications. For example, a typical mated LC connector pair is estimated to attenuate the optical signal by 0.75 dB. All optical losses between devices must be totaled to assess signal loss, which is the loss component of the calculation. The next step is to calculate the transceiver power budget, which has two parts: Transmitted Power Receiver Sensitivity These values are expressed in decibels (dB), where the difference between the transmitted power and the receiver sensitivity is the optical power budget. The transm itted power and receiver sensitivity vary by manufacturer. Both transceivers in the channel must be assessed and can be from different manufacturers. The accumulated media and connector loss must ex ceed the transceiver power budget by an acceptable margin (e.g., 0.5 dB or more) to help achieve re liable communications. The margin is calculated by subtracting the total optical loss from the transceiver power budget. If the calculated value is below the margin, consider a higher power tran sceiver to increase the budget, eval uate the design to determine if connectors can be removed, replace connector terminations with a pigtail splice to the cable, use a different cable with less optical loss, or shorten the run. Since this calculation is only an estimate, the actual op tical power should be field tested. Field testing of the channel can be performed using a power meter/light source (PMLS) meter. Note Field test data can be different than the estimate due to poor connector termination, sharp bends in cable, and care used in splicing cable. For more information, refer to the following link for examples of how to calculate fiber optic loss budgets: http://www.thefoa.org/tech/lossbudg.htm. 19Fiber Optic Infrastructu re Application Guide ENET-TD003C-EN-P Deploying a Fiber Optic Physical Infrastruct ure within a Converged Plan twide Ethernet Architecture Fiber Optic Cabling Systems Overview Figure 12 Illustration of Loss Ac ross Fiber Optic Cabling Channel Fiber Cable Management Proper fiber cable management is essential for high syst em performance, availability, and reliability. A strong cable management system helps protect the fiber op tic cabling from excessive bend, flexing, sagging, rubbing, crush, etc. Effective cable management designs include the fo llowing key elements: Bend Radius Control Cable Routing and Protection Patching Bundling Fiber Optic Cable Fiber Optic Cable Identification Bend Radius Control When fiber optic cabling must bend to go around corners or avoid obstructions, it is important to have a bend radius greater than or equal to th e manufacturer's specified minimum bend radius. This provision prevents excessive bending, which can cause physical damage to the cabling. There are two considerations for bend radius control: Dynamic—Cable flexing (especially during installation) Static—Cable held in place Fiber cable manufacturers specify both radiuses. For ex ample, the dynamic bend radius can be 20 times the Outer Cable Diameter (OD) and the static bend radius is typically 10 times the OD. Although fiber strands are very thin and made of glass, the strand is durabl e and can withstand some flexing. However, flexing can cause deformities in the fiber (called mircobend), leadin g to signal loss over time. Therefore, the stricter bend radius is dynamic. 
 20Fiber Optic Infrastructure Application Guide ENET-TD003C-EN-P Deploying a Fiber Optic Physical Infrastructu re within a Converged Plantwide Ethernet Architecture Fiber Optic Cabling Systems Overview Another risk to a properly terminated and validated fibe r cable is attenuation due to excessive cable bend in static applications (called macrobend ), which is a too-tight bend that al lows the light to escape the glass, reducing signal strength. Since the bend radius is based on the OD, the minimum bend radius for the application can vary. For example, a fiber patch cord cable has a static bend radius of 1.1 inch while a 12-fiber distribution cable has 2.4-inch bend radius. Bend radius is maintained by mechanical aids such as fiber spools, clips, fins, and product features built in to pathways as well as proper coiling ( Figure 13 ). Figure 13 Coiled Slack Loop In a 19-inch style computer or switch rack/cabinet, bend radius accessories can be installed to route fiber cable vertically and horizontally. Fiber enclosures and boxes typically have built-in slack spools. Also, supplied adhesive backed clips secure the cabling and provide strain relief. Figure 14 and Figure 15 show a fiber enclosure with slack spools. Figure 14 Fiber Enclosure Showing Slack Management—1

Although conduit is an excellent safeguard, it is designed for power wiring and has fittings, junction boxes, etc. where fiber cable under some tension can potentially bend the fiber beyond the allowable bend radius. Pathways such as cable trays and Jhooks have challenges with sagging and bends that can attenuate the signal, especially for unprotected standard distribution cable. To avoid these installatio n-related losses, the cable must be supported and bends must be controlle d. Draping unprotected distribution cable over J-hooks or laying the cable over an open tray with grids can lead to fiber sagging below the minimum bend radius. To avoid this risk, fiber optic cabling can be pulled through corrugated loom tube as shown in Figure 16 to provide needed rigidity and support. Fibers held in interlocking armor or DCF do not encounter these issues because the armor provides support and restricts the bend radius. Figure 16 Horizontal Cabl e Protection with Corrugated Loom Tubing Another challenge to pathways is a change in directi on when cables are routed do wn and sideways. Pathways such as the Panduit Wyr-Grid® Overhead Cable Tray System have waterfall and intersection bend radius components to properly route cables and achieve proper bend radius ( Figure 17, Figure 18, and Figure 19 ). These components snap onto the Wyr-Grid Overhead Ca ble Tray System where the fiber cable needs to bend.

Panduit Jhooks are designed with a radius to accommodate cables routed down ( Figure 20 ). Flat J-hooks have a sharp edge that can snag cables during installation and, more importantly, damage the fiber cable and lead to signal loss. Using bridle rings can lead to the same issue. Bridle rings and flat J-hooks are not recommended for fiber optic cabling.

The FiberRunner Cabl e Routing System is an enclosed pathway with bend radius control features. It also has transitions to equipment shown in Figure 21 and has various mounting capabilities for the ceiling, wall, and cabinet/rack. When routed in control panels, fiber optic cabling must be carefully laid in duct or protective tubing to avoid snags and kinks while maintaining proper bend radius. Adhesive backed mounting clips can hold fiber optic cabling in place outside of ducts along the panel wall or top ( Figure 22 ).

Optical fiber types are also available that have a meta l- (aluminum or steel) or polymer-based flexible armoring protecting the fibers.

 25Fiber Optic Infrastructu re Application Guide ENET-TD003C-EN-P Deploying a Fiber Optic Physical Infrastruct ure within a Converged Plan twide Ethernet Architecture Fiber Optic Cabling Systems Overview Patching The best practice for patching is to land fiber cable into an enclosure or box following a structured cabling approach. When fiber is terminated, several inches of the glass strand are exposed which are very fragile and need the enclosure or box to help pr otect the fiber from damage. Terminat ing directly to a connector without protection or support can lead to fa ilures. For rack and cabin et installations, a Panduit 19-inch style fiber cassette enclosure is a suitable choice. When installing fiber into a contro l panel, components such as the DIN Patch Panel or Mini-Com® Surface Mount Box ( Figure 23 ) provide patching. Another advantage of structured cabling is the ability to bu ild in spares ready to accommodate growth or to rapidly recover from link failure. Bundling Fiber Optic Cable The best practice for bundling numerous standard jack et fiber cables is to use a hook & loop cable tie (Figure 24 ). This type of cable tie cannot be over-tightened on the bundle, which can lead to cable damage. The environment of the installation is an important consideration when selecting a hook & loop cable tie. In more caustic environments, an elastomeric tie is a better choice. Elasto meric ties stretch to help prevent over tension, while guarding against weather, oil, salts, etc. Nylon cable ties can potentially damage the cable and are not recommended for standa rd jacket fiber cable. Nylon ties are on ly appropriate for armored or DCF fiber optic cabling.Ease of Adding More CablesGood (but eventually reaches fill capacity)Better (requires removal of top cover)Best Best Best Suitability for Unprotected InstallationsYes Yes Yes No (some installations use duct for protection)No Level of Protection Given to Cabling**** *** ** ** *Table 5 Pathway Comparison Pathways Conduit Duct/Raceways Grid Type Pathway Ladder Rack J-Hooks

Fiber optic cabling identification techniques include labeling and color coding. Labeling should be applied to enclosures, ports, patch cords, ho rizontal cables, etc. While some individuals consider comprehensive labeling an excessive cost, it pays dividends in effective management and troubleshooting of the physical infrastructure and also greatly shortens outages. Since some fiber cable types have small diameters, ap plying labels can be a challenge. To make the label readable a sleeve can be applied, which increases the diameter ( Figure 26 ). The identifying text on all labels should follow TIA-606B standards. Fo r clarity, there is usually a breakdo wn from the encl osure/rack, rack unit (RU), port, etc. that is consistent throughout the facility. For example, CP1.PP1.02 could signify control panel 1, patch panel 1, and port 2 and can identify VLANs, manufacturing process, location, network traffic type, etc. Color coding can identify VLANs, manufacturing process, location, network traffic type, etc. Color coding can be achieved with labels, hook & loop cable ti es, and color bands. Although fiber cable is color coded by cable type, additional color coding can be pe rformed for clarity using th e methods described above. Pre-Configured and Inte grated Products with Fiber Cable Management Panduit pre-configured and integrated products such as the Physical Network Zone System (PNZS), Industrial Distribution Frame (IDF), and Industrial Data Center (IDC) include fiber cable management features that follow fiber optic cabling best practices. The PNZS includes a strain relief bar to secure the fiber

The Industrial Automation and Control System (IACS) network within the Cell/Area Zone is a major building block of the CPwE ar chitecture. This is the netw ork that connects sensors, actuators, drives, controllers, and any other IACS de vices that need to comm unicate in real-time I/O communication. The Cell/Area Zone network must be de signed to meet the performa nce requirements of the IACS it supports, namely latency and jitter. This sec tion focuses on the physical infrastructure requirements and fiber optic cabling strategy for this portion of the industrial network. It describes the CPwE Cell/Area Zone and discusses key areas of the plantwide network and the CPwE Industrial Zone. Figure 27 shows the CPwE Logical Framework mapped to a re presentative physical plant floor layout.

From the LC bulkhead ad apter, a patch cord is connected to the device transceiver to complete the channel. An LC connector can be installed into environmentally protective housings. The housings are available in a variety of styles, which the IEC 61076-3-106 standard can be used to identify. In particular, ODV A, Inc., which administers EtherNet /IP, has chosen the Variant 1 housing for industrial protection. The hardened bulkhead patch cord is wide ly available, is applicable to multiple fiber media types such as OMx

It is used in panel-to-panel EtherNet/IP links using fiber optic cabling where special environmental requirements are stated (e.g., an IP67 rating). This connector system conforms to requirements stated in ODV A, Inc. specifications and addresses the more severe categories of MICE, typically M3, I3, C3, and E3 (which describes a harsh environment industrial space). The industrial LC bulkhead connector system consists of two main part s, the bulkhead LC adapter and the LC connector patch cord. The bulkhead LC adapter consists of a bulkhead with a seal to hold the LC adapter, which is attached by a nut. Dust caps help prevent contam ination of the adapter when not in use or prior to installation. Dust caps for the adapter are usually small pl astic inserts that are located into the adapter ferrule and are removed for normal data communications use. The LC connector patch cord consists of a flex tail for strain relief and a plug holder to secure the LC connector. Dust caps are also included to help prevent contamination of the connector when not in use or prior to installation. 
 31Fiber Optic Infrastructu re Application Guide ENET-TD003C-EN-P Deploying a Fiber Optic Physical Infrastruct ure within a Converged Plan twide Ethernet Architecture Media Selection Industrial Distribution Frame Fiber Optic Cabling Types and Products This section describes the fiber products most commonl y used in the Industrial Distribution Frame (IDF) of a CPwE architecture. The Industrial Zone (Levels 0-3) ties together the Cell/Area Zone (Levels 0-2) and Level 3 Site Operations in the CPwE architecture. This connection is acco mplished logically and physically through distribution switches connected with optical fi ber cabling. Due to the po rt density and features required for the functions performed by the distribution switch(es), often 19-inch rack mount gear is used in this application. Sometimes the switch may be an ente rprise-grade device. Therefor e, special care is required to protect the switches and have them function reliably in industrial environments. The Industrial Distribution Frame shown in Figure 29 is a solution with features to provide appropriate environmental protection while optimizing the cabling, grounding/bonding, and installation of devices. Figure 29 Industrial Di stribution Frame (IDF) The IDF is a dual-hinged enclosure (i.e., outer door and movable middle section) with RU mounting provisions that accommodate expected network switch depths. The movable middle section provides access to the back of the switches when opened. In addition, it provides access to the cabling entrance and cable management features. Although this type of enclosure has been around many years, it is only recently that it has been used to address numerous challenges rangi ng from cable management, cooling, MACs, enclosure mounting, etc. These challenges are overcome by deploying a pre-configur ed IDF that contains the necessary infrastructure components to helpl minimize deployment risks for reliability, maintenance, and missed schedules. Although active equipment varies fr om location to location, the pre-configured IDF can support up to two Cisco Catalyst 3850 switches, a 2 RU high Universal Power Supply (UPS), with up to 3 open RUs. The pre-configured IDF is designed with fiber cable management best practices which help protect the fiber cable from bend radius issues. Near the top of the enclosure, the cable is transitioned horizontally in a corrugated tube to maintain protection and landing on a fiber enclosure. This is a specially designed fiber enclosure that enables proper bend radius and appropria te slack management to the fiber adapter panel (FAP), handling many strands of exposed fiber cable. The fiber strand is terminated to an LC MiniComTM Connector that is inserted into the back of a FAP. The fiber enclosure ca n have 1-3 FAPs with varying adapter density and is secured to the front of the fiber enclosur e. The switch uplink port is connected to the front of 
 32Fiber Optic Infrastructure Application Guide ENET-TD003C-EN-P Deploying a Fiber Optic Physical Infrastructu re within a Converged Plantwide Ethernet Architecture Media Selection the FAP. At the rear of the FAP, the backbone cabli ng is connected and completes the channel. Patch cords must be carefully routed to the switches, maintaining acceptabl e bend radii. Labeling the cable is recommended and since the cable diam eter is very small, a label sleeve should be applied for the label. Industrial Zone Fi ber Optic Cabling Industrial Zone fiber optic cabling encounters many physi cal extremes in industrial environments, requiring more enhanced protection than cables in enterprise deployments. There ar e many options to encase the fiber optic cabling. The simplest option is corrugated tubing, which offers very basic and moderate protection such as crush resistance and some bend radius control because the material resists tight bends. More robust protection includes metal clad, dielectric-conduited, and fi ber in conduit, which are more suitable choices for industrial and harsh environments. Enterprise Fiber Cable in Conduit In harsh or splashdown environments, fiber optic cabling in conduit that is sealed an d constructed of stainless steel may be necessary for added protection. Conduit has the highest crush resistance when compared to other cable protection options. Deploying fiber in conduit is no t the same as deploying copper cables, especially power wires, because bend radius is not a factor for non-netw ork cables. When trans itioning cable 90 degrees, the conduit should be bent with the proper bend radius. The use of elbows and T connections is not advised for fiber or copper network cabling. The cabling routed through the conduit can be enterprise grade because the conduit provides all the necessary protection. When pulling fiber cable in conduit, the pullin g tension must be carefully monitored to avoid cable damage due to over-tensioning. Cable routes must include an adequate number of pull boxes to ease installation. It is not advised to mix different types of cabling in the conduit. Dielectric Conduited Fiber Armored Cable The Dielectric Conduited Fibe r (DCF) armored cable provides high-den sity connectivity and is constructed of a rugged plastic exterior conduit that is extruded over a standard tight buffered fiber distribution cable. DCF can be used in indoor applications that normally require armored cable or protection by conduit. The DCF cable is available with OM1, OM2, OM3, and OM4 multimode distribution cable or OS2 singlemode distribution cable routed in the condui t. The exterior may be colored to match the glass grade. For example, an OM3 DCF cable is colored aqua. DCF cable ( Figure 30 ) has a crush resistance six times greater than that of an unarmored cable rated at 5.88 N-m (52.4 in-lbs). The all-dielectric properties avoid the grounding and bonding requirements that pertain to the standard metal armored type and are required by c ode. The elimination of bonding connections simplifies installation and reduces cost. Since DCF is very light weight and mechanically su pports the fiber cable to avoid sagging, it can use easy-to-insta ll, low-cost J-hooks and ladder racks.
 33Fiber Optic Infrastructu re Application Guide ENET-TD003C-EN-P Deploying a Fiber Optic Physical Infrastruct ure within a Converged Plan twide Ethernet Architecture Media Selection Figure 30 Dielectric Conduited Fiber Level 3 Site Operations Fiber Optic Cabling Types This section describes the fiber products most commonl y used in the Level 3 Site Operations of a CPwE architecture. The Level 3 Site Oper ations ties together the Industri al Demilitarized Zone (IDMZ) and Industrial Distribution Fr ame in the CPwE archit ecture. These links are accomplished logically and physically through core switches, distribution switches, and firewalls (IDMZ) conn ected with optical fiber cabling. Indoor Distribution Cable Indoor distribution cable provides high density connectivit y and is used for intra-building backbones, routing between telecommunications rooms and cables in riser and plenum enviro nments. Distribution cable is the most popular indoor cable as it is small in size, lightw eight, and easy to install. When selecting distribution cabling, it is important to consider the different cable fire ratings to de termine which ones are appropriate for your specific installation requirements. The National El ectric Code (NEC) designates flame ratings for cables to help prevent the spread of fire and smoke in co mmercial and residential buildings. Depending on where the cables run in your industrial network, a requirement for a higher flame rating may arise. 
 34Fiber Optic Infrastructure Application Guide ENET-TD003C-EN-P Deploying a Fiber Optic Physical Infrastructu re within a Converged Plantwide Ethernet Architecture Media Selection Cable Fire Ratings Reference Guide Cable fire ratings need to be cons idered when specifying cab ling infrastructure to ensure local building codes are met. The rating reference guide below provides th e information needed to determine which rating is appropriate for different installation environments Plenum Rated Cable An Optical Fiber, Nonconductive, Plenum (OFNP) rating signifies cable that has passed stringent burn testing and is suitable for installation in to air plenum spaces. OFNP cables ha ve fire resistance and low smoke production characteristics. They can be installed in ducts, plenums, and other spaces us ed for building airflow. This is the highest fire rating fiber cable and no other cable types can be used as substitutes. Plenum Rated Cable An Optical Fiber, Conductive, Plenum (OFCP) rating differs from OFNP in that the cable contains metallic elements, typically armor, an d therefore conducts el ectricity. All other aspects of this rating are the same as OFNP. Riser Rated Cable An Optical Fiber, Nonconductive, Riser (OFNR) rating is commonly required when cables are run between floors through open vertical shafts. OFNR cables are used in riser areas which are building vertical shafts or runs from one floor to another floor. OFNR cables cannot be installed in plenum areas since they do not have the same required smoke rating as plenum rated cables. OFNP plenum cables can be used as a substitute for OFNR riser cables. Riser Rated Cable An Optical Fiber, Conductive, Riser (OFCR) rating differs from OFNR in that the cable contains metallic elements, such as a layer of armor, and therefore conducts electricity. All other aspects of this rating are the same as OFNR. Low Smoke Zero Halogen A Low Smoke Zero Halogen (LSZH) rating is sometimes referred to as low toxicity cable. When burned, PVC-based cables produce a cloud of toxic smoke cont aining corrosive compounds such as hydrochloric acid. The LSZH cables do not contain the halogen type compounds that form these toxic substances. Smoke emitted from burning LSZH cables do not produce the toxic halogen-based gases previously mentioned. LSZH ratings are expressed as OFN-LS or OFNR-LS if the cable also meets th e requirements of a OFNR rated cable. Patch Cords Patch cords provide flexible connection between the horizontal cabling infrastructure and the desired ports on the switch. These connections shou ld always be made via patching so link testing may be accurately performed and so re-routing at the patch panel is possible in case of a horizontal cabling failure.
 35Fiber Optic Infrastructu re Application Guide ENET-TD003C-EN-P Deploying a Fiber Optic Physical Infrastruct ure within a Converged Plan twide Ethernet Architecture Conclusion LC Patch Cord The LC patch cord connects the horizontal cable to the device and is the leading patch cord type in IACS applications for Rockwell Automation and Cisco industrial Ethernet switching (IES) products. For proper deployment, the patch cord must match the horizontal cable grade index. For example, an OM1 horizontal cable is only compatible with an OM1 patch cord. A best practice is to match the jacket color of the horizontal cable to the patch cord. For example, an OM3 aqua jacket must match the horizontal aqua cable. This simple color match greatly streamlines troubleshooting and management as the eye is drawn to the proper color. Standard Patch Cord Standard patch cords with LC connectors are available in various lengths. Patch cord lengths are stocked and sold in increments of feet, such as three feet, four feet, etc. Standard LC patch co rds are available in all of the grade index types, multimode OM1 through OM4 as well as singlemode OS2. Standard patch cords are tested and validated to help achieve quality performance in the field. As a general rule, the use of factory patch cords helps increase system performance and reliability by avoiding the potential variability in field-produced patch cords. Hybrid Patch Cord There are cases where legacy fiber is already present in a fiber installation with other connector types such as SC, ST, FC, MT-RJ, etc. Panduit provides patch cords that allow patching to the le gacy connector on one end to an LC connection suitable for joining Allen-Bradley SFP LC connections or other LC connections in the system ( Figure 31 ).

A-1Fiber Optic Infrastructure Application Guide ENET-TD003C-EN-PAPPENDIX A Fiber Optic Cable Handling and Safety When terminating optical fibers, ther e are specific precautions that must be taken to help maintain worker safety and to avoid damage to the cabling. For exampl e, workers should always wear proper eye protection and work in a clean, spacious envi ronment. Other precautions include: Eye Safety—It is strongly recommended that safety glasses be worn when handling bare optical fiber. The bare fiber is very sharp and can easily damage the eye. Isopropyl Alcohol—Isopropyl alcohol is flammable. Co ntact with the alcohol can cause irritation to the eyes. In case of contact with the eyes, flush with water for at least 15 minutes. Always use isopropyl alcohol with proper levels of ventilation. In cas e of ingestion, consult a physician immediately. Disposal of Bare Fibers—Pick up and discard all pieces of bare fiber with sticky tabs. Do not allow cut pieces of fiber to stick to clothing or drop in the work area where th ey are hard to see and can cause injury. Laser Light—According to Class 1M laser product of the IEC 60825-1 standard, do not directly view laser output with optical instruments. Viewing the laser output with certain optical instruments (e.g., eye loupes, magnifiers, and microsco pes) within a distance of 100 mm may pose an eye hazard. Use of controls or adjustments or performance of pr ocedures other than those specified herein may result in hazardous radiation exposure. –Never point the laser into the eyes of others. –Do not stare directly at the laser beam. –Do not set up the tool to work at eye level or opera te the tool on a reflective surface as the laser could be projected into your eyes or the eyes of others. Always turn the laser off when it is not in use or is left unattended for a period of time. Remove the batteries when storing them for an extended period of time to avoid damage to the tool if the batteries deteriorate. For more information on safely handling fiber optic cabling, refer to the Fiber Optic Association’s User's Guide to Fiber Optic System Design and Installation (http://www.thefoa.org/tech/ref/safety/safe.html ).
