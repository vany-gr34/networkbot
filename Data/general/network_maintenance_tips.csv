network maintenance tips,"i searched in this sub for the past couple of hours for past posts about network performance and resources to become better at creating performant networks or troubleshooting performance related issues. personally, i feel like i have a good handle on network availability and security in terms of design, implementation, and maintenance. however, i cannot say the same about performance. so does any one have good recommendations in the realm of network performance? i am looking to level up in that area but i dont know where to start. || make sure your mtu sizes are good. anything beyond that is probably not a network issue. || look for the section network performance related resources at the bottom of learn about bdp and nagle algorithm good luck."
network maintenance tips,"hey , i could use some help figuring out the best spot to drop in a ips in a network im working on where weve got multiple sites connected via sdwan over mpls, back to our central data center. the traffic path is basically branch sites hub routers wan firewall internal network were thinking of putting the ips in l2 transparent mode between the hub routers and the wan firewall, so we can inspect traffic coming in from the field before it hits anything important. couple of things im unsure about is this the right spot to put the ips? any issues with sdwan tunnels ipsecgre being broken or not inspected properly in this position? would you recommend placing it somewhere else? anyone have experience using tippingpoint specifically in sdwan setups? appreciate any advice, war stories, or gotchas youve run into. thanks! || if youre not planning on breaking open tls to inspect it and dealing with all of the associated fun of managing that process, id ask your security folks what they hope to actually see on the wire with ips in 2025. || does your firewall not have ips functionality already? if youre using an ngfw like a palo alto or fortinet, theyre already performing threat prevention, sandboxing, malware detection, etc. etc. if youre purchased those subscriptions. the benefits are probably quite low if youre adding another ips platform sitting adjacent to your firewall. || it depends on what threats scenarios you will be using the ips for. if you are worried that someone will break into your ipsec, and s8mple acl wont be enough, then you will need the ips infront of the sdwan router. if you are worried about internal users breaking in through your wan network, then why not enabling ips on your firewall?"
network maintenance tips,"hey all! network admin here, ive been asked by a local community college to tour around our large campus 20 or so networking students, show them the datacenter and a brief qa etc. ive never done something like this before and was wondering if you all have any advice or discussion you recommend? what advice would you have wanted to hear in your early years? so far i can come up with dont be afraid to make mistakes, but never hide them. you will get your hands dirty. learn how to use tools, dont be afraid of heights and crawl spaces. always carry a multitip screwdriver. learn something new every day. you will learn much faster trying something than reading about it. field work is king. automation is useful, but it isnt everything. know basic and intermediate commands and configs, or have offline access to them. make friends with the facilities team. be nice to everybody, but dont be afraid to say no to requests that go counter to securitypolicylogic and be able to explain why. youll need to know at least a little bit about many, many systems, and youll often need to prove that the network is not the root cause. anything im missing? thanks! || watch how others explain situations and learn how to translate bits, bytes, and packets into business impact. networking facilitates the business, so its very important to understand how it does. this will help prioritize issues both to you and others. || my network engineers dont touch equipment. the part about getting dirty and having to rackstack is more of a small shop thing. be clear about that. || use velcro, no zip ties!"
network maintenance tips,"i have been searching to try and find an answer but i keep coming up blank. so any thoughts will be appreciated. i have asked both dell software support and dell networking but neither of them has an answer. the networking group does not have any best practice for how to setup the switch for use with hyperv to best take advantage of vlt networking. i have dell pro support plus on all my equipment. the dell network team says it is a hyperv question on how they want it setup. the dell software support says this is a dell networking question and they both think they are independent. i am running hyperv and using powershell to create a virtual set using hypervport for load balancing. i have a 3 node cluster running 75 virtual servers on the cluster set does not support lacp my hyperv host are connected to two dell switches that are running dell os10 setup with vlt all servers are the same the following is an example of one server 1 connected to switch 1 with 2 ports connected to switch 2 with 2 ports all 4 ports on server 1 are in a single set virtual switch i have added host os, cluster network and backup network as virtual nics off the main set so the os sees the host os, cluster network and backup network iscsi is on dedicated nics that are not part of set and are using mpio with a nic connected to each switch. to best handle efficient routing of traffic between virtual servers and fast notification of down link events what is the preferred method of setup from the switch side of the equation. i run 10 rds session host servers using fslogix for profile storage so network latency matters to give my users a good experience. option 1 do nothing on the ports at the switch level. this requires that all traffic be routed and can put a lot of traffic on the backplane of the vlti interface between the switches because it does not optimize traffic. option 2 setup a port channel with lacp set to static. this will communicate to the vlt switches the group of ports are together for routing and notification and not creating loops. my understanding is this also helps with routing of traffic and notification during loss of 1 switch i.e. maintenance windows for switch. option 3 doing an lbfo nic team that does support lacp then apply the set switch to the team was an option but is not the recommended method from microsoft. also this only gives you one vmmq because the set only sees one nic so it cannot take advantaged of all 4 nics for offloading traffic. option 4 some other method best load balancing for vlt switches vnic is the guest nic and pnic is the physical nic currently all my virtual servers have 1 vnic best practice from microsoft is to use hypervport for all 10gb or faster nics. option 1 hypervport this basically sets a vm to a card the distribution is done by the os and just load them up in a round robin fashion. this vnic1 connects to pnic1 vnic2 connects to pnic2 vnic3 connects to pnic3 vnic4 connects to pnic4 vnic5 connects to pnic1 etc. option 2 dynamic the traffic from vnics gets send out on all 4 pnics in round robin but only one pnic can receive traffic. i do not know if it the process is smart enough to know that it is talking with a vm guest that also on the same switch then it would only send out on the pnics that are connected with that same switch. this could generate a lot of traffic on the vlti backplane if half of the packets are coming from the other switch. i must be over thinking this which is not unusual for me but the lack of documentation is pretty astounding considering this technology has been around for 10 years. || vlt seems to be the dell version of vpc. dont do anything on the switches, set is switch independent and works fine as is. || yep. no fancy config on switches. how load is balanced and bandwidth utilized depends on if the port is set to dynamic or hyper v. you should probably use hyperv port for your vms. refer to the guide from lenovo below which details set requirements and setup for hyperconverged. it is the same for converged, but includes rdma setup. microsoft also has documentation on this on learn.microsoft.com. || yes you dont really do any lag or anything. just present the ports and set itself will handle it."
network maintenance tips,"hey guys, i recently cleared my phone screen and got moved to a loopscheduled soon. im not an expert in networking, and wanted to know what topics i should master to nail the interview. also there is coding via livecode, which topics should i be covering and an sample questions would be appreciated! also, since this is an l4 position, will there be any network designing or any whiteboard design i should be aware of. i really appreciate any responses or tips. ps ill post my experience once im done interviewing || it would be better to post this on amazon employees reddit thread. good luck!"
network maintenance tips,"i have problem in title. i want to migrate aps to meraki cloud from existing network and i found this presentation after upgrading system to 17.9.6 option to migrate ap has appeared but there are no entries there. i checked the inventory and have no misconfigured aps in either category, additionally i reapplied country setting just to make sure. what could be wrong here? after googling, i dont see any troubleshooting options, everyone assumes that if country is ok, it should work. guide is new last month, though i see that migrating the wlc itself is now requiring higher version 17.12. anyone can confirm if that it is the reason? i would prefer to avoid upgrade of big version in current time as i wont have comfort of any longer maintenance periods till summer. || "
network maintenance tips,"hey guys, i have a loop scheduled up soon for a network engineer role at amazon. they mentioned about livecode tool, i wanna know what is it and should we share the screen or do i have to code in the livecode link? any tips and leads are appreciated || its a shared whiteboard tool, the interviewer and you whoever has the link can see whats typed or edited. you dont need to do a screen share for it, they will very likely ask you to keep the webcam on during the call. you might get asked to think aloud while the white board is being used. || no need to share screen but they will know everything"
network maintenance tips,"hey everyone, im a firstyear undergrad currently doing a research internship focused on wireless sensor networks wsns. my professor assigned me a project to replicate and then optimize the results of a recent ieee paper titled deep reinforcement learning resource allocation in wireless sensor networks with energy harvesting and swipt. ive implemented the custom wsn environment along with dqn and actorcritic models. after tuning and debugging, my loss convergence and throughput results are pretty close to the paper, but not identical yet. the main challenge now is deciding whether this level of replication is solid enough to start experimenting with new methods like ppo, sac, or better baselines, or if i should first aim to match the original figures more precisely. has anyone here worked on similar drl wsn projects? would love some insight on how closely replication results should match before moving to improvements tips for improving throughput without breaking convergence any best practices for comparing rl agents to baselines in these types of setups thanks in advance! happy to share coderesults if helpful. || "
network maintenance tips,"i have joined a new company where we will be deploying around 300 routers with a sdn controller. i havent worked on service assurance for many years and now i need to look at a new solution. i worked on ibm netcool many years ago on a noc of 50 people managing a big telco network. i was wondering what are the new monitoring platforms. does grafana allows managing alarms like in netcool acknowledge, manually clear...etc alarms like in netcool. thanks for sharing any tips for pro and cons. || it really depends on many things. budget, needs, and team ability to use the tool are all important. we semirecently did a pov between a bunch of providers. my personal favorite was datadog, but we went with logicmonitor. anyway you go, i would suggest a cloud console as youre eventually going to need an overlay and isolation strategy given the state of the industry. || depending on the manufacturer of the router the use of liveactions livenx would make sense || maybe you should read up on modern monitoring theory first before trying to apply oldschool thinking to a greenfield deployment."
network maintenance tips,"hi everyone, im working on a pxe deployment project and joined midstream, so im trying to catch up. were using pxe to image new laptops, but were encountering issues where the boot process gets stuck at start pxe over ipv4. heres our setup 3 pxe servers we have three servers dedicated to pxe imaging. ip helpers were using ip helpers to direct pxe requests to these servers, rather than dhcp options. dhcp functionality ive confirmed via packet capture that dhcp is working correctly. the local service desk reports that laptops consistently halt at the start pxe over ipv4 stage. this suggests a problem beyond basic dhcp. my challenge i need to isolate whether the issue is networkrelated, specifically regarding the ip helpers and pxe server communication. direct wireshark captures on the server side are currently not feasible. questions 1. what network tests can i perform to validate the ip helper configuration and ensure proper communication between the laptop and the pxe servers? 2. are there any specific tools or techniques i can use to diagnose pxerelated network issues without serverside captures? 3. given that were using ip helpers instead of dhcp options, are there any common pitfalls or configuration checks i should focus on? 4. what type of information should i ask the local service desk to gather, that will help me narrow down the problem? any tips or guidance would be greatly appreciated! thanks in advance. || are the ports on the switches getting in the right vlan? when we had to deploy pxe boot machines we ended up pulling cisco ise off the ports so they wouldnt get blocked || have you confirmed the biosfw in use on the laptops supports dhcp relay? some of them are dumb and anything other than the most basic setup is too much for them. can you get a mirrorspan port on a switch somewhere you could run wireshark on? || theres no such thing as a pxe server. pxe is not a network service. pxe is a process which runs on the client device. it requires a variety of services from the network, probably dhcp, dns, tftp and precisely what is required to make it work will depend on the devices youre trying to boot. some examples most clients expect to collect their boot file via tftp with the location specified in the siaddr server nameip and file path to file dhcp options, but some will accept a url via the file option. some clients cant seem to do dns lookups, so the servers must be specified by ip address. i recently worked with some clients which absolutely ignored the siadder next server option, choosing instead to try to receive the boot file from the dhcp server. i cant imagine solving this problem without packet capture at the client and also at the servers."
