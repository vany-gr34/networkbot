network health check tools,"hello guys, i am still learning networking and i just had this idea and wondering if this is already implemented but i dont know about it . this is my rough idea to create a network protocol , and with this, every switch will execute show spanningtreesupports all flavors and show lldp neighbours commands and even portchannels details , and include it in the packet and pass it to root bridge , lets say after every 30 sec. or instead of executing those commands just get data from sysdb like in arista switches and on root bridge , ill collect this packet and a simple script parse those details to a json file and i have a tool that can create a nice ui topology from this data. so, i have seen people in tac teams , that many times customers dont really provide topologies , or even for network designers , if a new guy comes in and he wanted to know the topology this could help right ? is this good idea ? is this already made ? e well, well, well, after reading comments , i realize that its already implemented this was a bad idea i guess || isnt all of this already available via snmp normaly? and how would you implement this on propriatary hardware software? || of course software like this already exists but they dont use stp as not every network is using it but instead use lldp, cdp and whatever other discovery protocols to find management ips. you either give it an ip range and credentials or a single device and credentials from which it will discover and log in into neighbouring devices and collect data. my goto software for ohh, lets get a topology of this network and an inventory of all devices and ports is netdisco || check out librenms. it autodiscovers by lldp once you add one switch and automatically creates network topology diagrams."
network health check tools,"so i had this idea to implement a dlp data leakage prevention solution with a mix and match of tools. so the basic idea would have a proxy server capable of intercepting and replaying requests kind of like how burp suite works. route all the traffic from the employee laptops through this proxy server to be able to read all of the network traffic http and included. using these logs, pass it to some analysis engine where i have designed rules to prevent some form of data leakage. i am kinda stuck at the proxy server part, i came across this tool called mitmproxy which pretty much is what i need, it intercepts the requests, then i can write those logs to a file and replay the request back to the server seamlessly but a problem that arises is that mitmproxy is written in python and i am doubtful if it would be able to handle all of that traffic that goes through each employees workstation. i looked into using squidssl bump but it seems pretty complex to set up any suggestions on how to proceed with this? || "
network health check tools,"i am interested in getting a ba to make me look more appealing to my current long term employer. long story but i can only relate to how my employer operates because i really have no experience in the outside job market. but basically, when you fill out internal job apps, if the job requires a bachelor degree, and you cant check that box then you automatically get filtered out. so im basically trying to open more doors for myself. but at the same time, get something that i am interested in as opposed to just a bachelors in a business admin or something. i currently work in the utility industry doing field type work and have an engineering associates degree. ive always been interested in networking and thought that might be a good place to start. the question is, i dont really have a feel for how the job market and industry is. my goal would be to use my field experience and association with a bachelors in network engineering and possibly work towards critical infrastructurecyber security kind of career. i would also sort of like to work remote so i can travel when i become an empty nester. currently about to sign papers at wgu for their network engineering cyber security ba just looking for some opinions and suggestions. thanks. || naw. just do computer science at wgu and get it certs. it will look better on your resume with more flexibility. || its similar in the job market. if you dont have a ba, it closes some doors. not all, but definitely some. can speak from experience. certs and job experience sometimes opens those doors back up, but not all. || wouldnt be a terrible decision. however, in my opinion, for the field of network engineering, industry certifications are more valuable and they would still be needed to move up. you could do something more broadgeneral like engineering technology for a 4year undergrad degree. thats kind of the point of it. its a challenging degree though. dont rule out a simple degree like business or general studies. you can study take cert tests in parallel to undergrad. then you specialize in something."
network health check tools,"hello network enthusiasts, i got the chance to help build a small isp network. we are talking about 6000 customers. i sketched something here the requirements are to keep the network as simple as possible with the equipment they already have in use. the routers are connected to the internet via different ip transit providers on both sides and have ospf and bgp in between. i have implemented some security features. antiipspoofing olt checks ipv4 mac binding learned by dhcp dhcp authentication with option 82 added by olt and checked by dhcp server l2 isolation on olt i want to add features to minimise the risks of the large broadcast domain. for example, i would like to disable arp learning as the router fills the arp table based on dhcp traffic. i think this would prevent scans from the internet flooding the network with arps. but then i would have to make sure that there was some sort of arp sync between the routers. i have also thought about configuring a different vrf for the customer and only exporting subscriberroutes 32 to the default vrf. but this also has some redundancy issues if one router goes down and the other has no learned subscriber routes... i also read about ipsubscriber sessions, but i do not have an aaa server and would be very happy to get around without another server. the setup in the draft would work, but of course there are many security issues, please list anything that comes to mind. open to suggestions and criticism to fix this setup. edit my last attempt was trying to sync the arp tables arp redundancy group 1 peer loopback ohter crt sourceinterface loopback10 interfacelist interface bundleether1.82 id 8 but this unfortunately does no sync the dhcp learned arps only the dynamic ones stored on 0rsp0cpu0 . and as i said i would like to disable dynamic arp learning on the routers. i need the arp with ip to be synced to the second router. crt 01 interface bundleether1.82 description xgsponinternet ipv4 address 192.168.168.2 255.255.254.0 proxyarp localproxyarp ipv4 unreachables disable encapsulation dot1q 82 00cpu0 address age hardware addr state type interface 192.168.168.1 0000.0c07.ac52 interface arpa bundleether1.82 192.168.168.2 5087.892a.c0d4 interface arpa bundleether1.82 192.168.168.21 480f.cf27.27d3 dhcp arpa bundleether1.82 192.168.168.100 000034 9c37.f47d.4528 dynamic arpa bundleether1.82 0rsp0cpu0 address age hardware addr state type interface 192.168.168.2 5087.892a.c0d4 interface arpa bundleether1.82 192.168.168.100 000034 9c37.f47d.4528 dynamic arpa bundleether1.8 crt 02 interface bundleether1.82 description xgsponinternet ipv4 address 192.168.168.3 255.255.254.0 proxyarp arp learning disable localproxyarp ipv4 unreachables disable encapsulation dot1q 82 ! 00cpu0 address age hardware addr state type interface 192.168.168.1 0000.0c07.ac52 standby arpa bundleether1.82 192.168.168.3 e0ac.f13d.4404 interface arpa bundleether1.82 192.168.168.100 000034 9c37.f47d.4528 dynamic arpa bundleether1.82 0rsp0cpu0 address age hardware addr state type interface 192.168.168.3 e0ac.f13d.4404 interface arpa bundleether1.82 192.168.168.100 000034 9c37.f47d.4528 dynamic arpa bundleether1.82 || reading through everything, i dont think this design is going to work from a practical perspective as youve found because youve essentially used an enterprise branch office, dual wan design as your isp design. except you dont have any firewalls at your as edges which means youre wide open to the world with no safeguards and you have no aaa of any kind that could theoretically be used for things like subscriber validation, which basically means a lot of the options you could take to mitigate security issues are nonexistent. since youll probably ignore this and try to push forward anyway, ill at least answer your question on arp sync between asrs. the answer is simply no. arp tables between asrs do not sync and in that platform are treated as local to device only. || proxy arp is no solution for not knowing how routing works. || i havent used this platform in a while, but look into subscriber arp scalemodeenable and bng geo redundancy"
network health check tools,"hey all! network admin here, ive been asked by a local community college to tour around our large campus 20 or so networking students, show them the datacenter and a brief qa etc. ive never done something like this before and was wondering if you all have any advice or discussion you recommend? what advice would you have wanted to hear in your early years? so far i can come up with dont be afraid to make mistakes, but never hide them. you will get your hands dirty. learn how to use tools, dont be afraid of heights and crawl spaces. always carry a multitip screwdriver. learn something new every day. you will learn much faster trying something than reading about it. field work is king. automation is useful, but it isnt everything. know basic and intermediate commands and configs, or have offline access to them. make friends with the facilities team. be nice to everybody, but dont be afraid to say no to requests that go counter to securitypolicylogic and be able to explain why. youll need to know at least a little bit about many, many systems, and youll often need to prove that the network is not the root cause. anything im missing? thanks! || watch how others explain situations and learn how to translate bits, bytes, and packets into business impact. networking facilitates the business, so its very important to understand how it does. this will help prioritize issues both to you and others. || my network engineers dont touch equipment. the part about getting dirty and having to rackstack is more of a small shop thing. be clear about that. || use velcro, no zip ties!"
network health check tools,"hi networking folks, ive recently inherited an aws cloud environment thats... lets just say, full of surprises. its a mix of legacy and inprogress migration workloads. every other day were firefighting because systems cant talk to each other, sometimes its route table issues, sometimes security groups, sometimes traffic blackholed in transit gateway or lost in a firewall appliance. what im really looking for is a tool that can visualize traffic flows in aws. something that lets me see which eni is talking to which eni whether its flowing through transit gateway which security group or nacl it hits if its being handled or blocked by a 3rd party firewall appliance like palo alto or fortinet bonus if its affordable or open source, and if nothing good exists, im seriously considering building one. maybe even turning it into a product. anyone here using something like this? or building one? would love to hear what tools you use, or what you wish existed. thanks in advance! || freeopensource that would work natively to gather public cloud traffic. public cloud are black box, you cant really monitor it like classic network infra."
network health check tools,"im in the final steps of a new role coming my way. it will be with one of the big 4 major network vendors and im super happy to have made it this far in my career to where i can even stand among, what i feel, are the greatest to ever do the job. the role is for a services engineer that will be a part of a regional account team for my immediate area of a few states. the job will be a really nice base salary, with a 15 to 20 percent yearly bonus for the company hitting certain metrics which im told almost always occurs and the usual boat load of rsus that have until recently double or tripled after vesting time comes around. the bump from my current position will more than likely be significant 100k a year more possibly, even though i am compensated pretty well where im at now. now the issue..... i feel incredibly blessed to have this offer coming, but i will have to do all the things that come with a position like this. ill have the inevitable imposter syndrome going on of course and have a lot of learning to no doubt take on in the first year at a minimum. i will have travel to customers sites, which should only be a state away or so, and im told its around 20 percent travel for that. all other time is remote. im currently in a hybrid role where i am and come in a few days a week, with no travel at all beyond that, and a great working environment. its high workload, but nothing i cant handle because i know this environment cold, and not much challenges me here. after talking to my wife, she obviously knows its the job of a lifetime and wont tell me to not take it, but she knows that she will struggle with those times i am away for work. for this reason, and because my current role is not bad at all, and we dont need the money, i am thinking about declining when the offer comes in. that thought makes me feel stupid, because i feel like jobs like that dont come around often obviously. i almost feel like they are the 1 type of jobs that people boast on here for having, and id be throwing that away. has anyone been offered something like that and declined? someone make me feel better about possibly saying no here. edit 1 to clarify a few things being asked.... my spouse has had some recent health scares lately. nothing super serious, but my current role allows almost complete freedom and obviously no travel, so i have been here for her in anything shes needed. those health scares have for the most part, subsided, and she thinks if things continue to trend this way, that shell be fine. thats been the main point of her worry is those health scares and something happening while im traveling. obviously we would miss each other like any married couple, but shell survive that loneliness fine, its the health aspect that bothers her most. hopefully its not a big deal and she thinks that i should accept the offer and hopefully her health scares are over. you just never know for sure. || if you dont feel stupid youre not being ambitious enough. that is normal. discomfort is a prerequisite for success || while the fortinet job seems like a godsend, proceed with caution || most people are imposters in their role. its not your problem if theyve hired you then they believe you have the requisite competence. ai is commoditizing intelligence anyways so its no longer rare. just take it, worse that happens its not a fit, you find out traveling isnt for you, and you find another job that requires no travel. and its not like youve got to stay in the role forever, the big 4 major network vendors likely have plenty of internal opportunities, many of which wont require any travel. just switch up after a year or two if another internal role comes up."
network health check tools,"i have a dell n2224x switch and for the life of me cannot figure out what might be disallowing traffic originating from certain vlans to hit the management ip. switch ip vlan 10 host 1 ip vlan 40 host 2 ip vlan 20 some scenarios i can pingssh to the switch ip from host 2 but not host 1. i can pingssh to other devices in vlan 10 from host 1, but not the switch itself. all vlans have been created on the switch i can pingssh to a nondell switch ip that is connected via a trunk interface on the dell. im kinda stumped on what might be going on here. hopefully i have provided enough context for some things to check. thank you for your time. edit this has been solved. i changed the unused outofband management port from 192.168.40.x to an unused network segment and immediately the switch management interface would accept and route traffic from my vlan 40 nodes. very odd behavior for something that should be outofband. really appreciate all your suggestions and assistance. || sounds like theres acls access control list in place. what does the command show ipaccess lists display? || is ip routing turned on? || is at least one interface with vlan 10 online? not sure if every switch does it but i know hparuba switches will disable a vlan if there are no active ports."
network health check tools,"i have a customer who we did a network design for just over a year ago. we talked them through all the pros and cons as part of the design process and they selected to terminate all the vlans onto their cisco switches and then just have a layer 3 transit up to the firewall. this firewall was easy to spec as it was essentially just a case of how big are your internet pipes, how much might they grow over the next 56 years. boom there is a firewall. we are now 12 months layer and they are saying we want to terminate all the vlans and they have a lot, and want more onto the firewall. i agree this is a superior and potentially more secure design but i suspect if we do this it will just overload the firewall as it just wasnt speced for that use case. the customer, and rightfully so, is saying give us some figures to backup that statement. that got me thinking.... what is the best way to do this? my initial thought process is put netflow in on the core switch and look at the traffic levels between the various vlans. we could also monitor the traffic levels on the svis its a cisco core switch and see what traffic levels they get. currently the customer is using prtg but is there some other tools that could give us better reporting? but what does reddit think? what have i missed? what else could i consider? ||  || you dont say anything about the fw capabilities. its very difficult to answer the question in the title if you dont specify the firewall itself. and i do agree with other comments it all depends what you want to do with the traffic when it hits the firewall. do you just want to do regular l4 filtering or are they going with something like l7 filtering appid with pa, ssl decryption? are you going to employ security profiles to filter ew traffic as well? is the firewall doing any ipsec tunneling or ravpn? basically, its not just the amount of traffic, its also what youre going to do with it. newer fortigates and pa series starting with 400 series are small beasts and can handle a lot of abuse of course, the more you need, the higher you go on the ladder when speccing the fw as well. as for routing, i disagree with some of the comments unless youre talking about very specific routing usually reserved for datacenters, firewalls are more than capable of doing it, at least major vendors in the field are. if youre talking about just intervlan routing, then double that. ive been in networking field for past 20 years, last 10 years mostly security engineering firewalls and unless im working with a very specific type of a company that absolutely needs to have line speed for intervlan traffic, all vlans are terminated on the firewall, no exception im done with the days of 2010 years ago when i was trying to figure out which acl on a switch is blocking something. || group networks inside a vrf and use the firewall as the gateway. this reduces the number of vlans on the firewall and allows east west between like networks with minimal security concern."
network health check tools,"hello everyone! ive recently been put in charge of a complete network replacement project at my company, taking over from a colleague whos no longer involved. while i have a technical background, this is my first time leading a project of this scale, and id really appreciate any advice from those of you whove been through something similar. the scope of the project includes designing a new network topology cleaning up existing racks and cable closets reorganizing patch panels, switches, and getting cable management under control replacing legacy switches with new ones and configuring them to support the updated network design right now, im trying to figure out what questions i should be asking, what to prioritize, and which common pitfalls to watch out for. heres what id love your input on what would your first steps be in a project like this? any templates, tools, or documentation methods you find invaluable? any common mistakes youve seen or made during network overhauls? thanks in advance any insight would be hugely appreciated! || ive wrapped up a network overhaul a month ago for one of our facilities and its my favorite project to do. i work in the manufacturing industry and oversee at least 6 facilities, and have led at least a dozen infrastructure overhauls. handling a project and seeing it through will require detailed planning and clear communication to stakeholders to help minimizeprevent unplanned issues. we still do things manuallyoldschool, nothing fancy. general overview 1. break down the project into small actionable tasks and identify who will be handling what. 2. document and review your network infrastructure logical and physical. identify and label critical portscables. i like to create a table where one column lists the connections from the patch panel to the current port interface, and a separate column lists where theyll be connecting to on the new network switch. i also like using visio to create visual diagram mapping 3. identify what services will be affected, so that these can be communicated to management. 4. review and verify current configs are backed up. then check the current configs will be able to apply on new switch or if you may need to write up a new template. 5. keep in mind the environment power, environment, humidity, etc. are you adding new idf? if also factor in accessibility to idf. 6. on the day of cutover or before cutover, do a final plan review with stakeholders to make sure any litle detaillast minutes changes went unnoticed and everything verbalizedcommunicated so that all individuals are on agreement. we had to involve devop team and our consultants to make sure their applications and services are safely shutdown, then resumed and verified. past mistakes that were madeissues experienced 1. incompatible hardware were orderedreceived. just doublecheck the specs sheets. 2. insufficient cables 3. the one time i forgo a final plan review previous network projects went without any hiccup, we ran into technicals that extended the outage by an hour past planned outage widnows. 4. unclear communication. be direct and concise in communication. vague and wordy communication will cause the team to fumble. feel free to message me for questions and support!"
