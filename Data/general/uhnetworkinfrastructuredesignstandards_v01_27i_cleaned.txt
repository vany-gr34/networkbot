Building Distribution Frame (BDF, also known as BICSI Entrance Facility ) is the area where the demarcation between the inter -building and intra -building cabling systems is affected. This securable room is to be dedicated to this purpose, with no other building services sharing the space. 
Network Infrastructure Design Standards University of Houston Version 1.27i 6 Rev. 3/23/2020 Horizontal Cross -Connect (HC) is a cros s-connect allowing horizontal cabling to be interconnected to backbone cabling. Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF) provides for demarcation between the per -floor horizontal customer service cabling and the building’s data, voice and video backbone cabli ng. This room contains the electronic equipment that transitions between the building backbone and the end user's telecommunications equipment. This securable room is to be dedicated to this purpose, with no other building services sharing the space. IDFs are allocated to each floor of a building and house the communications equipment and related wiring that serves that specific floor. Several IDFs may be located on a single floor in order to maintain the cable length limitations specified within particular standards. Lateral Fiber (LF) is the term used to describe a fiber optic cable of a smaller fiber count (12 – 48 is typical) that originates from a BDF and terminates into the Metro Fiber for its network connectivity. Main Cross -Connect (MC) is the cross -connect normally located in the BDF for cross -connection and interconnection of entrance cables, first -level backbone cables, and equipment cables. Main Distribution Frame (MDF, also known as BICSI Entrance Room ) is the main telecommunications service entr ance into the campus. It may or may not be where the BDF is located. Metro Fiber (MF) is the term used to describe high fiber count cables (144, 288, etc.) that traverse the campus, have midpoint splice cases, and act as the fiber backbone of the campus. Network Facility (NFs, also known as Telecommunications Rooms [TRs] or BICSI Equipment Rooms [ERs]) are environmentally controlled spaces and secured rooms housing telecommunication and network equipment such as data, voice and video components and their associated connectivity infrastructure. The types of Network Facilities are Main Distribution Frame, Building Distribution Frame, Intermediate Distribution Frame and Telecommunication Enclosure. Telecommunication Enclosure (TE) is a secured case, cabinet or housing for telecommunications equipment, cable terminations and cross -connect cabling. 5.0.2 REQUIREMENTS 5.0.2.1 GENERAL Refer to Master Specification 1100 Network Facility Fittings for information related to authorized products and installation requirements.
