A fast and reliable WAN service that connects all of an or ganization ’ s o ffic es is no longer a luxury—it is crucial to business success. The pr oductivity of a workforce can be attribut ed to and enhanced by the quality of the enterprise WAN network. As the WAN has grown and become more important, the oper ational and financial challenges of oper ating the network have become more of a burden to or ganizations. The challenges of oper ating the WAN need to be addressed in a way that enhances not only performance and reliability, but also security, privacy, and compliance. A complete enterprise WAN network architecture can e ffectiv ely address these growing challenges. Several trends in the enterprise have had an affect on complexity, network performance, and scale. The following sections cover these trends.1
Centralized Cloud Data Centers A fir st trend is centralized cloud data centers and the distribution of content. In the past, applications, data, and content were largely localized—users needed access to a local email server and database and could, for the most part, perform their duties without impacting the WAN. Today, many enterprise applications and data are stored in either centralized data centers or in a hybrid cloud and accessed via constrained and o ften oversubscribed WAN links. This c en tr alization of enterprise applications and data has strained the tr aditional model of WAN access, which was to provide low bandwidth and oversubscribed links to remote sites. The growth of bandwidth requirements, not only for connected devices but for business-critical applications, has led the enterprise to seek new ways to deal with the WAN and its design and performance. Edge Compute The second trend is edge compute driven by the need to lower application response times and the cost associated with sending data round-trip to a centralized cloud for every tr ansaction. With the compute moving closer to the edge and closer to the consumer of data only the essen tial subset of data is sent to the centralized cloud for latency critical applications. This is not only driving bandwidth growth as tr affic travels between the edge and the cloud, but also placing higher demands on WAN performance. This is leading enterprises to reconsider their WAN design. Explosion of Internet–Connected Devices The third trend is the explosion of Internet–connected devices. A decade ago, the enterprise needed to deal only with computers and other directly connected devices that were standardized and issued by the IT department. Today, every user has a smartphone, tablet, and lap t op—o ften their own—that require an Internet c onnection. Each of these devices consumes a great deal of bandwidth and can impact network performance. While some enterprises ignore this tr affic impact, the pressure to keep the workforce happy and pr oductiv e has forced many enterprises to adopt a “bring-your-own-device” (BYOD) policy and use Wi-Fi and security policies to enable network access to all of a worker’s devices. Enterprises must build a network that can not only handle the bandwidth requirements of today’s devices, but also expand to handle the e xponen tial growth in bandwidth c onsump tion over the next 5 to 10 years.2
Enterprises Needing to Operate as Service Providers A final trend is the view that enterprises should operate like service providers, tr eating the or ganization as customers for their services and mee ting high standards for service delivery. T r eating large enterprises as a service provider poses great challenges to the tr aditional WAN designs and architectures. Many companies choose to build completely private WAN clouds, while others look to build hybrid networks that give them control and management of strategic portions of the network instead of relying solely on an outside provider. This movement introduces a great deal of complexity, especially for the tr aditional model of remote site uplinks, and demands a new approach to priv atizing the WAN. Enterprises that fit this mold are looking for ways to simplify the tr ansition to a private WAN and need new architectures to support this tr ansition all while increasing network performance and reliability. Scope The Juniper Networks Enterprise WAN solution is designed to meet the needs of an increasingly complex network segment that is a key to current and future business requirements. This document serves as a high-level overview of the Enterprise WAN solution and includes an overview of challenges, business drivers, design c onsider ations, and r ec ommendations, as well as a high-level overview of the solution. The use cases and scenarios covered by the enterprise WAN solution include:

Enterprise WAN Overview IN THIS SECTION Public Enterprise WAN | 6 Hybrid Overlay Enterprise WAN | 7 Private Enterprise WAN | 8 WAN Ag gr egation | 9 Internet Edge | 10 The enterprise WAN consists of network segments and c on figur ations that enable the enterprise to generate revenue in today’s highly connected, dynamic environment. The enterprise WAN itself consists of business site types that must be interconnected to enable business and revenue. The corporate LAN and data center are at the core of the enterprise WAN. These sites provide a bulk of the enterprise support, applications, and business enablers. Figure 2: Enterprise WAN overview 5
The enterprise WAN is the sum of the c on figur ations and design of the in t er c onnections between the data center and corporate headquarters and the rest of the enterprise. The enterprise remote sites can consist of campus environments as well as small o ffic es, revenue gateways (such as a storefront or branch sales o ffic e ), and other remote locations. The enterprise WAN is o ften designed to provide dedicated in t er c onnection with partners, home-based workers, and other support resources. This is the key to the solution as it provides the backbone over which most enterprise tr affic travels. Understanding the enterprise WAN as a whole is key to understanding the subsequent solution components—WAN ag gr egation and Internet edge. A large enterprise WAN can be built in several ways to accommodate control, security, and performance concerns. The three models of enterprise WAN network are public, hybrid overlay, and private. Public Enterprise WAN A public enterprise WAN uses a purely service provider MPLS network to provide pseudo-private enterprise WAN services. The service provider hands o ff a circuit to the enterprise site and provides all MPLS services transparently to the enterprise. For most enterprises, this architecture provides excellent service with little to no management required by the enterprise. Many service providers manage the MPLS customer edge (CE) routers at all branches, e ffectiv ely making the WAN transparent to the enterprise and its users. While this approach is appropriate in most cases, large enterprises o ften choose to augment or replace the carrier-managed op tion with their own architecture and design. A hybrid overlay network is o ften one of these choices.6
Figure 3: Public enterprise WAN is managed en tir ely by the service provider Hybrid Overlay Enterprise WAN The hybrid overlay network lets the enterprise consolidate and control WAN resources where it makes financial and geographical sense—for example, overlaying private WAN securely over the Internet to augment a carrier-provided private MPLS service. In a hybrid overlay network, regions with a high density of enterprise o ffic es are aggregated onto an ag gr egation router that the enterprise controls. This ag gr egation router has a high-speed transport to the rest of the enterprise.7
Figure 4: Hybrid overlay enterprise WAN Private Enterprise WAN O ften, the hybrid approach is not sufficien t, and the enterprise wants to build and manage the en tir e MPLS network. In these solutions, the carrier provides core services to regional ag gr egation hubs and acts only as logical transport. The enterprise performs all MPLS, class of service, and other c on figur ations. This model gives the greatest control to the enterprise, but o ften at great expense.8
Figure 5: Private enterprise WAN is almost en tir ely managed by the enterprise. Remote sites and home users are brought into the network using IPsec over public transport WAN Aggr egation In hybrid overlay and private enterprise WAN deployments, the key to the solution are the WAN ag gr egation routers that are o ften co-located at the carrier o ffic e. As such, the WAN ag gr egation routers are a key focus of the overall enterprise WAN solution. WAN ag gr egation is a network architecture that consolidates multiple networks, such as the campus, branch, and data center networks, onto the enterprise WAN network. WAN ag gr egation stit ches together networks and site types to enable seamless c ommunication between the enterprise’s locations.9
Figure 6: Sample WAN aggr egation routers that combine multiple remote branch sites into a single enterprise WAN The most common ag gr egation model is a single backhaul to a corporate headquarters or data center where all site-to-data center tr affic and site-to-site tr affic are routed within the enterprise. The ag gr egation of WAN c onnections can be private leased line, MPLS Layer 3 VPN, Layer 3 tunneling, any of the Layer 2 VPN technologies, or by an Internet VPN. It is common to find a mix of these c onnection methods in the WAN ag gr egation as the enterprise o ften selects transport based on business need and criticality. Internet Edge The second part of the overall enterprise WAN solution is the Internet edge. The Internet edge acts as a centralized gateway for the enterprise, providing c onnectivity to the Internet for branch o ffic es as well as enabling c onnection of remote workers and partners to enterprise resources.10
Figure 7: Sample Internet edge network with remote branch tr affic backhauled to headquarters for Internet access You can also use the Internet edge to provide: 
- Backup c onnectivity to the WAN for branch o ffic es when the primary WAN c onnectivity fails. 
- Transport for remote workers to access the enterprise, either using so ftw ar e (SSL VPN) or hardware gateways ( fir e w all with IPsec VPN). 
- Access to services the enterprise hosts. Enterprise WAN Challenges The network is critical to the oper ation and inno v ation in the enterprise because it lets employees, suppliers, and customers access new applications and services. As networks have become faster and11
more robust to support the current and next g ener ation business applications, complexity and cost have also grown. Growth in the WAN segment has introduced key challenges to the enterprise, including deployment ease, fle xibility, and scalability. How does the enterprise deploy and operate a WAN easily while ensuring that the components implemented are future proof and can scale to meet future demands? Other challenges lie in not only enabling cloud services, but also the recent technological advancements in multi-cloud and edge compute. Companies are increasingly looking to cloud service providers to augment their business, and a WAN that can enable this agility is essen tial to success. Adding services and devices to meet this challenge increases the total cost of ownership of the WAN and can have an e ffect on the bo ttom line. Once installed, a new challenge is management of the WAN. The network should be easy to manage— addressing this challenge is particularly pr oblematic as the complexity of the network increases. Finally, the WAN should be services ready. A WAN implemen tation must support technologies that enable future growth and the addition of value-added services. The key challenges of WAN deployments are: 
- Ease of deployment and management along with fle xibility and scalability. The enterprise WAN consists of geographically dispersed sites of various size and purpose. This dispersion and differ enc e of purpose can be addressed by introducing a common network that excels at carrying tr affic of varying importance between sites as well as between partners and third-party support or ganizations. Deployment of a single WAN architecture is not enough. The technology used to enable the WAN network should also have common factors. Equipment that shares the same oper ating system can be more easily migrated to more robust platforms as needs dictate. Having a single oper ating system throughout the network also makes it easier to introduce new services and c on figur ations, as the same c on figur ation can migrate wherever it is needed. 
- Ensuring that cloud services are easily adopted. The drive to reduce costs combined with the need to provide a high-quality user experience o ften collide and cause business needs to come second to the need to control expense. An answer to this c on flict is found in the adop tion of cloud services. An e ffectiv e enterprise WAN enables a robust and high-quality c onnection to the data center through a direct c onnection to a cloud data center. M ee ting this challenge is critical in controlling cost while enhancing user experience. 
- Ensuring that the network is services ready. The network should be designed to be fle xible, scalable, resilient, and secure as these char act eristics are all requirements of any service-ready network. An e ffectiv e architecture is modular in nature, allowing the addition of new services to the enterprise WAN such as VPN, Network Address T r anslation (NAT), and stateful fir e w all services. In addition, the enterprise WAN should support implemen tation of value-added services such as WAN ac c eler ation and content caching.12
Enterprise WAN Design C onsider ations IN THIS SECTION Ease of Deployment/Designed for Flexibility and Scalability | 14 Resiliency and Security | 14 Ease of Management | 15 Ease of O per ation | 15 Services Ready | 16 This section focuses on high-level design c onsider ations of enterprise WAN use cases. Each of the c onsider ations should have high-level design goals that inform the choices made during the design of a new or upgraded enterprise WAN. The prime design c onsider ation are: 
- Easy to deploy—A top goal in any network architecture should be ease of deployment. A f an tastic solution that features complicated deployment scenarios can encounter more issues than a network that features an easy and documented deployment. 
- Easy to manage—An e ffectiv e design features simple and centralized management. The ideal scenario has a single operator with a single pane of glass who is able to manage the en tir e network. Designing ease into the management of the network is as important as any other factor in the network design. 
- Easy to operate—Availability of aut omation tools means greater visibility, actionable insights, and the ability to self heal and self drive the networks through AI. Aut omation reduces errors and outages while lowering oper ational costs. 
- Flexible and scalable—New network architectures should be designed to grow and change as business needs dictate. Installing a design that just meets the needs of business today is a recipe for increasing expenses and complexity as the network is upgraded piecemeal. 
- Resiliency and security—Architecture that is vital to business success should be designed with the e xpectation that failure and security breaches are not only possible but also probable. Rather than designing around unplanned outages and attacks, design in a way that expects outages and attacks on the network and its protected resources. 
- Services ready—A network should be able to easily adopt new services. The ability to introduce services in line with e xisting network flo w s is a key design c onsider ation. This lets you add services like WAN ac c eler ation, content caching, elevated security ( an tivirus, intrusion de t ection and pr e v en tion ), to name a few, to the network ( o ften without the addition of new hardware).13
Ease of Deployment/Designed for Flexibility and Scalability O r ganizations can have thousands of remote sites spread out among geographical locations that have labels like branch o ffic e, regional site, or headquarters. WAN ag gr egation design should inform the building of a network for all locations, regardless of their label or purpose. This means building a network that scales. S tandar dization is one way to design for scalability. By introducing and adop ting a small number of standard designs for common portions of the network, the op tions for network deployment are limited and simplified. To enhance scalability further, use a modular design approach. Begin with a set of standard, global building blocks. From there, design a scalable network that meets business requirements. For instance, in an enterprise network, we might start with a core module and then connect an Internet edge module and a WAN module to build the complete network. Many of these modules are the same for service design. This provides consistency and ease of scalability in that you can use the same modules in multiple areas of the network to maintain the network. These modules follow standard layered network design models and use separ ation to ensure that interfaces between the modules are well de fined. Resiliency and Security A key to maintaining a highly available network is building in the appropriate redundancy to guard against failure, whether it is link or circuit, port, card, or chassis failure. This redundancy is carefully balanced, however, with the complexity inherent in redundant systems. Overly complex redundancy features can cause more problems than they prevent by introducing failures. Over engineering a network’s resiliency can result in c ommunications failure. While all or ganizations require redundancy, you need to avoid making the redundancy too complex and reliant on too many other modules. The failure of a single component can cause a network failure. With the addition of a significan t amount of delay-sensitiv e and dr op-sensitiv e tr affic such as voice and videoconferencing, we also place a strong emphasis on resiliency in the form of convergence and recovery timing. Choosing a design that features failure de t ection while reducing recovery time is important to ensuring the network stays available in the face of even a minor component failure. Network security is another important factor in designing the architecture. As networks become larger and more complex, there are more entry points and areas where security vulner abilities exist. E ffectiv e WAN ag gr egation and enterprise WAN designs ensure a secure network that does not restrict usability for the end user, hindering the customer experience in the process. The security design should address vulnerability and risk while enhancing the user experience as much as possible.14
Ease of Management An e ffectiv e WAN ag gr egation and enterprise WAN architecture should be designed to be easily managed and operated. Ideally, you would use a single pane of glass in the form of a network management application, or a c ollection of applications, to implement, maintain, and troubleshoot the network. Old methods of using CLI and truck rolls to manage the network become more of a burden as the complexity of the network grows and as it becomes more vital to the user experience. An architecture that focuses on making the network easy to manage includes all of the elements found in FCAPS, an ISO model and framework for network management. FCAPS includes the following network management elements: 
- Fault management by a central system that polls network elements via SNMP to verify status while network events are sent to the network management system via SNMP traps. 
- C on figur ation management via third-party tools that manage and execute scripts, or through GUIbased systems that allow bulk changes throughout the network. 
- Ac c oun ting management is essen tial when multit enancy, or “pay to play” are in use. When you have multiple business units with discreet billing and service requirements, you need to tie usage to those accounts. 
- Performance management lets the or ganization verify that service-level agreements are met, either between the enterprise and the service provider, or between the enterprise IT or ganization and the business units (internal SLAs). 
- Security management is essen tial to the network. The ability to coordinate security throughout the enterprise and at the service points where security policy is applied is crucial to securing the network. Beyond the c on figur ation of security, the management system should support the r eporting of security events so policies can be evaluated and changed to meet evolving security threats. An e ffectiv e management system provides a complete FCAPS functionality and enhances the management, security, and accountability of the underlying network design. Ease of O per ation As enterprise bandwidth grows so does the WAN size and complexity. However, the complexity associated with managing such infrastructure does not have to increase pr oportionally thanks in part to aut omation tools. Aut omation of network oper ations is less error prone and therefore avoids outages while reducing the CAPEX.15
A future-proofed network is designed to stream telemetry, not just provide visibility. It can also extend analytics to provide actionable insights with further extensibility to self-driving networks by selfdiscovery, self-monitoring, self -c on figuring and self-healing. The success of any self–driving network depends on algorithms that can predict the state of the network and the necessary action with a highlevel of accuracy. The performance of pr edictiv e algorithms depends on the data models ( c orr elation engines), and the fidelity of such data models is directly pr oportional to the amount of data collected (telemetry) over time. Services Ready Flexibility, scalability, resiliency, and security all are char act eristics of a services-ready network. An architecture featuring a modular design enables technologies and services to be added when the or ganization is ready to deploy. In a services-ready architecture, new platforms and extensive network changes are not required to enable service adop tion—the network is modular and built to accept these new services with little change required. A network architecture that is designed and c on figur ed with class of service (CoS), for instance, is ready to support high-quality voice and video. A network that is designed and c on figur ed with multicast is ready to support e fficien t voice and video delivery. A network with customer edge (CE) platforms that support WCCP is ready to add caching and ac c eler ation services without requiring extensive changes. Other services that you should consider are VPN services, NAT, and stateful fir e w all services. A network that is designed and built to support these services from day one can be considered services ready. The Juniper Networks Enterprise WAN S olution IN THIS SECTION WAN Ag gr egation and Backbone | 17 Internet Gateway | 19 Secure Overlay | 20 Services | 21 Modernize Your Mission C ritical Enterprise WAN Infrastructure | 21 The Juniper Networks enterprise WAN solution is built on the following modular building blocks:16

- WAN Ag gr egation and backbone 
- Internet gateway 
- Secure overlay (IPsec VPN) 
- Services The target markets for this solution include any or ganization that has a wide base of hub sites with a high degree of in t er c onnectivity demands. Large enterprises that operate as pseudo-carriers are the key target of the use cases provided in this solution. Government agencies, univ er sities, financial and health care or ganizations, and large technology companies are most likely to bene fit from the deployment scenarios in the enterprise WAN solution. Large enterprises are the most likely to establish private ag gr egation points of presence, enabling them to consolidate WAN c onnections prior to backhaul to the headquarters or data center sites. This approach provides a central point of control for regional hub sites, enabling cost savings on backhaul—a single ag gr egation router is connected via high-speed backhaul to the carrier or private MPLS cloud as well as to the Internet edge—and management. In the ag gr egation model, a single point of presence provides all enterprise transport services to the regional hubs. This minimizes c on figur ation points and enables more robust resiliency and performance to those hub sites. The next section covers each of the modular components of the WAN ag gr egation solution. WAN Aggr egation and Backbone There are several modular c on figur ation op tions for the WAN backbone. Using the WAN ag gr egation model (Table 1), the solution features c on figur ations for three deployment scenarios—dual router with dual circuit, single router with single c onnection, and single router with dual c onnection. Table 1: Enterprise WAN Remote Site Type Deployment ScenarioSize P latform Transport Head End Router Dual Router Dual CircuitLarge MX L3VPN/L2VPN/IP TunnelsWAN backbone Internet VPN, WAN backbone17

Figure 8: Enterprise WAN deployment scenarios Internet Gateway The Internet gateway is a f oundation of the WAN ag gr egation deployment scenario. The Internet and mixed ag gr egation scenarios require Internet gateway functionality to properly provision WAN ag gr egation. The Internet gateway provides Internet access to hub site users, or more commonly, provides a public transit for IPsec VPN c onnection back to the headquarters or data center. In many cases, hub Internet tr affic is backhauled to the company headquarters to enable security services such as URL filt ering, an tispam and an tivirus, and intrusion de t ection and pr e v en tion (IDP). By backhauling tr affic to a headquarters site, the enterprise can manage and maintain security between its users and the Internet in a central location. By sacrificing some speed and performance, the enterprise can ensure the security of its user base in this scenario.19
Figure 9: The Internet gateway The Internet edge module of the larger WAN ag gr egation solution provides cloud-grade r outing and security to regional enterprise sites that require local Internet access. The local access either provides direct Internet c onnection to the remote sites, or it provides a transit network to allow intra-enterprise IPsec VPN c onnectivity. The ag gr egation hub providing Internet edge services is services ready and can be easily c on figur ed with services that enhance the security of the enterprise remote sites. Services such as dynamic NAT, access lists to whitelist or blacklist-specific destinations, stateful fir e w all and IDP services, and activ e/ activ e load balancing to multiple ISPs are all key components of the solution. Secure Overlay Secure overlay lets home users or branches with limited MPLS provider op tions to access the enterprise. The branch o ffic e or home user obtains Internet access from whatever local provider is available (via cable, fiber, or satellite). The enterprise then provides a managed, c on figur ed device with IPsec services to the branch or home user. Another access method is a secure client on the home user’s computer that allows so ftw ar e-encryp t ed access to the enterprise. This access can be built within the data center using20
a VPN gateway or so ftw ar e VPN t ermination device, or it can be hosted in the cloud closer to the Internet edge. Services The enterprise WAN solution is services ready, but what services might an enterprise want to bring into the network? The solution supports Web Cache C ommunication Protocol (WCCP) to enable WAN ac c eler ation devices to enhance the user experience. Inline, network-driven security services, such as stateful fir e w alls and deep packet inspection, are also supported. When the enterprise hosts sensitiv e data or is likely to be the target of intrusion or attack, control plane pr o t ection and denial-of-service pr o t ection (DoS and DDoS) are integrated into the solution architecture. For enterprises that use r eal-time or recorded video content (such as financial streams to banking centers or video lectures in the education sector), the solution supports content caching. This service is adopted through enhancements to the network’s handling of multicast tr affic and by the r outing hardware ability to redirect specific flo w s to secondary devices or virtual appliances that locally cache and serve content to remote sites. The enterprise WAN can add these services in line with little to no disrup tion of the user experience.

Enterprise WAN S olution B ene fits IN THIS SECTION Improved O per ational E fficiency | 23 Reduced O per ational Expense | 23 Improved Flexibility and Value for Investment | 23 Security | 24 Cloud-Grade Reliability | 24 The enterprise WAN solution o ffer s the following bene fits to large enterprises seeking to use private MPLS or hybrid overlay network design with WAN ag gr egation: 
- Improved oper ational e fficiency 
- Reduced oper ational expense 
- Flexibility and value for investment 
- Security 
- Cloud-grade reliability22
Improved O per ational E fficiency Large enterprises can simplify the network by adding regional WAN ag gr egation routers to a private MPLS or hybrid overlay network. Ag gr egating low-speed c onnections to hub sites into a regional ag gr egation tier that supports high-speed backhaul, enables a single point of regional management and improves the performance of hub sites by providing high-speed services from the region to the headquarters. This solution includes aut omation to simplify network oper ations, lower cost and minimize oper ational errors. The aut omation suite is comprised of network visibility enabled by the JUNOS Telemetry (JTI), network health analytics via the Paragon Insights, and oper ational aut omation using Paragon P ath finder. Further, these aut omation tools are provided as programmable frameworks, wherein applications such as custom route c omputations can be built with the goal of in fluencing r outing decisions. This enables oper ational simplicity by standardizing the oper ating system within a region and leveraging the aut omation tools, saving network oper ational time in provisioning and tr oubleshoo ting the WAN ag gr egation tier. Using Juniper Networks MX Series 5G Universal R outing platforms, the WAN ag gr egation architectures in the enterprise WAN solution support link speeds from 10 Mbps all the way through 100 Gbps. For non-Ethernet interfaces, the MX Series supports DS3 through OC192. The design also uses a single oper ating system (Juniper Networks Junos® oper ating system) on all routers, from the ag gr egation hubs to small CPE devices used at remote sites (or by home users). Reduced O per ational Expense Regional ag gr egation of enterprise remote sites lets the enterprise provide lower-speed local uplinks to the sites in a region. The WAN backbone then provides a higher-speed backhaul transit to the headquarters. The enterprise can control the c on figur ation from the hub to the backbone and across the backhaul to headquarters. The WAN backbone model enables the enterprise to provide high-speed services to regional remote sites at po t en tially lower cost, using the low-speed links to aggregate sites to a higher-speed transport. Improved Flexibility and Value for Investment The MX Series routers support a wide array of upgrade op tions. S o ftw ar e licenses and Modular Interface Cards (MICs) can be added to increase the functionality or capacity of an ag gr egation hub. Within a range of MX Series (low-end or high-end) routers, so ftw ar e licenses can be activ at ed to enable higher speeds on the same platform, supporting expansion in region or the addition of new services to remote23
sites. The MX Series also supports a wide array of interface types, enabling a remote site to upgrade from legacy circuits to high-speed Ethernet easily, as the uplink is performed only between the remote site and the ag gr egation hub. Finally, the network is built for elasticity and performance. Combining a robust class-of-service implemen tation with fle xible backhaul features such as MPLS tr affic engineering (TE), IP tunneling such as GRE and IPSec, Ethernet private VPN (EVPN), SPRING, virtual private LAN service (VPLS), the enterprise can more e ffectiv ely guarantee application performance to the remote sites, ultimat ely improving the user experience and, by extension, the bo ttom line. Security The enterprise WAN solution and WAN ag gr egation deployment scenarios are built from the ground up with security as a key component. Logical separ ation of remote tr affic or even the separ ation of differ en t oper ating units within the remote sites is provided. This logical separ ation lets the enterprise control not only whom on the outside each oper ating group can communicate with, but it controls c ommunication and leaks between groups within the same enterprise. Cloud-Grade Reliability The ability to keep the enterprise running is another key bene fit of the enterprise WAN solution. The MX Series r outing platform is a cloud-grade component designed with full resiliency at its core, using redundant control plane and switching plane hardware as well as redundant power and cooling. In a design model where the enterprise acts as a private service provider to its remote sites, the ability to keep the WAN ag gr egation routers available and performing is critical to the success of the solution. At the r outing and so ftw ar e layer, MPLS resiliency mechanisms such as MPLS fast reroute (FRR) and ondemand paths are supported to enable fast recovery from core issues that affect backhaul r outing to the headquarters. In a multiple chassis deployment, where hardware redundancy is supported by uplinks to multiple regional ag gr egation points of presence, the MX Series supports multichassis link ag gr egation group (LAG) and Virtual Chassis, enabling a single site to redundantly connect to multiple ag gr egation points while allowing that uplink to appear as a single logical uplink.24
