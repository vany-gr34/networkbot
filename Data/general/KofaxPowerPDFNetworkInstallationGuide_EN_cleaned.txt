Transform file names by language Language Transform file Arabic 1025.mst Chinese (Traditional) 1028.mst Chinese (Simplified) 2052.mst Czech 1029.mst Danish 1030.mst Dutch 1043.mst English 1033.mst Finnish 1035.mst French 1036.mst German 1031.mst Hungarian 1038.mst Italian 1040.mst Japanese 1041.mst Korean 1042.mst Norwegian 1044.mst Polish 1045.mst Portuguese (Brazil) 1046.mst Russian 1049.mst Spanish 1034.mst Swedish 1053.mst Turkish 1055.mst 10
Installation prerequisites The product requires the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 package to be installed on the client computers. Webview2 is required for using the SignDoc and DocuSign functionalities. This installer is located in the Prerequisite folder in the installation media or download package. 
- File name is ndp48-x86-x64-allos-enu.exe. 
- Required on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows.  If you perform the standard installation procedure via Setup.exe in the root folder of your installation media or download package, the Setup.exe installs the required software packages automatically before launching the product installer. A reboot may be required after installation of the components. Rights Management Service Power PDF uses Microsoft Purview Information Protection by default. To step back to the legacy Active Directory Rights Management Service, follow the steps in the section below.  Set the ISINSTALLRMS command line switch to "0" to disable right management services. Use legacy Active Directory Rights Management Service To step back to Active Directory Rights Management Service to work with legacy RMS-protected documents, do the following: 1.Install Active Directory Rights Management Service Client 2.1 by proceeding with any of the following steps: 
- Use the client installer appropriate for your operating system, provided with the Power PDF Advanced installation media or download package: 
- For 32-bit operating systems: .\Tools\AD_RMS\setup_msipc_x86.exe 
- For 64-bit operating systems: .\Tools\AD_RMS\setup_msipc_x64.exe 
- Download the installer from Microsoft at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/ details.aspx?id=38396. 11

Installation in distributed environments In a distributed environment, administrators can use a two-step procedure for software deployment: 1.Customization The Kofax Customization Kit is available from the Tools folder in your installation media or download package ( .\Tools\CustomKit\CustomizationKit.exe ). The kit presets certain installation options to configure client installation. 2.Client installation Installs the product on the client workstation according to the options configured with the Customization Kit. The following sections describe how administrators can customize and deploy the product. Please note that the manual client installation can be replaced with mass deployment. Customization Kit The Customization Kit for Power PDF Advanced and Power PDF Reader gives administrators the ability to customize the installation of Power PDF Advanced products prior to deploying the applications across an organization. System requirements: The Customization Kit requires that at least Microsoft Windows Installer (MSI) 3.1 and Windows .NET Framework 4 are installed on the client computer.  You must use a Kofax Customization Kit version that is identical to the product version. Customization Kit overview The Kofax Customization Kit helps to create a personalized package of Kofax Power PDF Advanced for organization-wide deployment. Use this tool to define where to install Power PDF Advanced, predefine the serial number and make it read-only, set feature installation states, set visibility of features on the Custom Setup dialog box, configure default application settings, deploy custom files and import predefined application settings. 13
Kofax Power PDF Network Installation Guide When you finish the necessary modifications and publish a package with the Customization Kit, the tool stores the modified settings in the following way: 
- Personalization, General, Application Integration, Connectors, Document Processing, Languages, Application Options, and Upgrade Behavior settings are stored in the admin_customSettings.mst transform file. This transform file is located beside the .msi package file. 
- Additional Files and Import Application Settings are stored beside the .msi package file. The subsequent sections detail the most of the settings offered by the UI but not all. More settings are available by command line switches. For detailes on all settings, see Command line switches and features.

Kofax Power PDF Network Installation Guide Client installation using command line Kofax Power PDF Advanced supports special deployment systems such as Active Directory, Microsoft System Management Server and System Center Configuration Manager. The client installation procedure always requires administrative privileges and must run with a percomputer installation context (ALLUSERS=1).  The suppression of the required reboot does not eliminate the need for a reboot. A required reboot must still be performed before installing any hotfixes or using the product. The following sections provide examples of client installation scenarios, using the following placeholders: 
- {install_path}: Replace this placeholder with the installation folder path. If you omit the INSTALLDIR parameter, the product is installed into the default installation folder. (Installation requires an empty destination folder.) 
- {source_path}: Replace this placeholder with the source folder containing the customized .msi package file. In the following examples, the selected installation language is French (1036.mst). See Transform file names by language for details. If you do not specify a language transform file: 
- _setup.exe prompts for language selection. 
- msiexec.exe installs the product in its default language (English). Install Power PDF Advanced using command line 1.On the client computer, use Run as administrator to open a Command Prompt window. 2.Run the following command: MsiExec.exe /i "c:\{source_path}\Kofax Power PDF Advanced.msi" INSTALLDIR="c:\{install_path}" TRANSFORMS="c:\{source_path}\1036.mst;c:\{source_path}\admin_customSettings.mst" 3.If you saved a .mst file with Generate Transform in the Transform tab, then use one of the following commands: 
- MsiExec.exe /i "c:\{source_path}\Kofax Power PDF Advanced.msi" INSTALLDIR="c:\{install_path}" TRANSFORMS="c:\{source_path}\1036.mst;c:\{source_path}\your_saved_transform.mst"

Use setup.exe to trigger the installation of prerequisites. If you use Msiexec.exe, ensure that you run Command Prompt as administrator. Client installation command line examples The following example shows how to install Power PDF Advanced with different options. To install the product with a basic UI and without message box on completion, use the applicable command line: 
- MsiExec.exe /i "c:\{source_path}\Kofax Power PDF Advanced.msi" INSTALLDIR="c:\{install_path}" /qb 
- _setup.exe /s /v"INSTALLDIR=\"c:\\{install_path}\" /qb" Where q defines what type of UI the installation uses: 
- /qn specifies that the UI is not displayed. 
- /qb specifies a basic interface with a progress bar. Furthermore, (if used) a plus sign (/qb+ or /qn+) specifies that a message box is displayed when the installation is finished. To install Power PDF Reader with the same options as above, use one of the following commands: 
- MsiExec.exe /i "c:\{source_path}\Kofax Power PDF Reader.msi" INSTALLDIR="c:\{install_path}" /qb 
- _setup.exe /s /v"INSTALLDIR=\"c:\\{install_path}\" /qb" During the installation of the application, specific installation options are available. Several InstallShield Wizard pages walk you through the available features. These installer features cover the different integration settings (into Microsoft Office, Windows, and Internet Explorer) and the optional components of the product. These features are controllable via Customization Kit and/or command line switches. 23

Client installation using Active Directory Active Directory is a feature of Microsoft Windows servers. Group Policy (GPO), a component of Active Directory, includes a Software Installation snap-in that enables an administrator to create a network installation. The administrator can install software to Windows clients. The administrator cannot use the snap-in to install to clients with older versions of the Windows operating system. Active Directory supports three main installation scenarios: Publish to Users, Assign to Users and Assign to Computers. 
- Publish to Users adds the product to the list of installed programs that the user can access from the Control Panel. The program is not installed until the user selects to add it. 
- Assign to Users adds a program shortcut to the user's Start menu and Desktop, and to the list of installed programs that the user can access from the Control Panel. 
- Assign to Computers installs the software on the computer during the next computer reboot. Power PDF Advanced supports the Assign to Computers scenario and installs the software when the computer is rebooted. The installation takes place silently, and the software is installed for all users on the computer.  Power PDF Advanced does not support the Publish to Users or Assign to Users scenarios. Active Directory also supports ZAP files as a mechanism for installing programs that are not compatible with the Microsoft Windows Installer. Because Power PDF Advanced is Windows Installer compatible, ZAP files are not necessary. Deployment example (installation in existing organizational units) 
- A deployment target computer that is a member of a domain, site, or organizational unit. 56

For details on installation and upgrade, see Install Kofax License Server and Client. By default, if no Allow List file is available, Kofax License Server provides licenses upon request from any user. Allow List format and location To control the group of authorized users, you need to maintain an Allow List file on the computer that runs Kofax License Server. If the file is missing, all license requests are granted without user authorization. The Allow List should be a plain-text file with UTF-8 encoding ( NamedUsersList.txt ) placed in the common application data folder. By default, the full path is: C:\ProgramData\Kofax\Licensing\NamedUsersList.txt  To override the default path, specify a report path by the ReportsPath setting in app.config. In this case, the Allow List path copies the report path. 79
Kofax Power PDF Network Installation Guide The Allow List should specify all users authorized to consume a Power PDF or Power PDF Reader license by the Windows user name (domain\username), the security identifier (SID), or both. The list is case-insensitive. You may list a user with multiple entries. Place each entry in a separate line. For example: kofax\user1 Kofax\user2 S-1-5-21-2349634669-572318953-3610473378-2204 The above Allow List example grants the following: 
- User1 can request a user license with kofax\user1. - User2 can request a user license with Kofax\user2. - The user with SID S-1-5-21-2349634669-572318953-3610473378-2204 can request a user license. 
- Any other user requesting a user license adds an error message to the log.  User name formatting depends on the corporate environment. To make license allocation straightforward, use the SID if possible. Allow List updates You can edit the Allow List file, freely updating, removing, or adding user entries. Kofax License Server processes any updates automatically. 
- Add a new user to instruct Kofax License Server to let the user consume a license as soon as Power PDF requests one on behalf of the user. 
- Remove all entries of a registered user to instruct the server to release the consumed user license. However, this does not immediately affect the previously registered client. The client can continue to use Power PDF until the registration period is expired, but it cannot acquire a new registration and consume a license. 
- Delete the Allow List file to suspend user authorization, and allow all users to request user licenses. Licenses already consumed remain registered and active. Import users from an Active Directory group Administrators can export users from an Active Directory (AD) group to NamedUsersList.txt using the following PowerShell script sample.  The script requires the Active Directory tools installed on the computer and running PowerShell as an administrator. See Install Active Directory tools for details. # Prompt the user to enter the group name $groupName = Read-Host "Enter the name of the group" # Get the group object $group = Get-ADGroup -Filter "Name -eq '$groupName'" # Get the members of the group, including those in nested groups $members = Get-ADGroupMember -Identity $group -Recursive # Create an empty hash table to hold the SIDs $sids = @{} 80
Kofax Power PDF Network Installation Guide # Create an empty array to hold the user objects $users = @() # Loop through each member and add their SID to the hash table foreach ($member in $members) { if ($member.objectClass -eq "user") { $sids[$member.Sid.Value] = $true $user = Get-ADUser -Identity $member -Properties Name, EmailAddress $users += $user } } # Output the unique SIDs to a file $sids.Keys | Out-File -FilePath "NamedUsersList.txt" # Select the properties to export to the CSV file $properties = "SID", "Name", "EmailAddress" # Export the user objects to a CSV file $users | Select-Object $properties | Export-Csv -Path "NamedUsersList.csv" -NoTypeInformation The sample script prompts for the AD group name and then outputs these files: 
- NamedUsersList.txt includes SIDs in a format appropriate for the Allow List. 
- NamedUsersList.csv includes attributes such as user name and email address to provide more information. Install Active Directory tools Importing users from an Active Directory group requires Active Directory tools installed on the computer. You can install the RSAT tools directly from the Windows Settings app: 1.Open the Settings app. 2.Go to Apps > Optional features. 3.Click Add a feature. 4.Scroll down and select RSAT: Active Directory Domain Services and Lightweight Directory Services Tools. 5.Click Install. About logging user license requests Kofax License Server writes all messages specific to the Allow List file to the default License Server log file in the common application data folder. By default, the path is: C:\ProgramData\Kofax\KSALic\logs The file naming follows the Lic_YYMM.txt schema, where 
- YY stands for the year on two numeric digits. 
- MM stands for the month on two numeric digits. For example, the file name for July 2023 should be "Lic_2307.txt". 81
