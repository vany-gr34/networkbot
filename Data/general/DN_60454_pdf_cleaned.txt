- FIRE
- NET™ (NFN). Six types of HS-NCM are available: 
- HS-NCM-MF for connecting nodes with multi-mode fiber-optic cable 
- HS-NCM-SF for connecting nodes with single-mode fiber-optic cable 
- HS-NCM-MFSF for connecting multimode and single-mode fiber optic mediums on the same network. 
- HS-NCM-W-2 for connecting nodes with twisted-pair wire 
- HS-NCM-WMF-2 for connecting wire and multimode fiber-optic medium on the same network 
- HS-NCM-WSF-2 for connecting wire and single-mode fiber-optic mediums on the same network Each HS-NCM can accommodate up to two node addresses. For example, one HS-NCM can provide network communication for bothan N16 and an NCD. When not connected to a fire alarm panel, the HS-NCM defaults to repeater mode and can be used to boost signal distances or to passdata transmissions between two differently configured network seg - ments when wire and fiber co-exist on a network. NOTE: Correct configuration is dependent on network design; refer to the High-Speed NFN Manual, P/N 54013.For further information and diagrams, refer to the HS-NCM Manual, P/N 54014. HS-NCM-W-2 Features
