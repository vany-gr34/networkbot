NCM-W, NCM-F, NCM-SMOF Network Communications Modules  DOC-02-109Intelligent/Addressable Devices General The Network Communications Module (NCM) provides NOTIFIER’s AFP-2800 Fire Alarm Control Panels with a means to connect to NOTIFIRENET™. Three types of NCM are available: NCM-W for connecting nodes with twisted-pair wire, and NCM-F for connecting nodes with multi-mode fibre optic cable and NCM-SMOF for connecting single-mode fibre-optic cable. NCM-W Features 
- Supports twisted-pair wire medium.
- Two programmable data thresholds
- Transformer coupling provides electrical isolation between nodes
- Pluggable terminal wiring with strain relief
- Pluggable service connector (feeds signal directly through) in the event that power must be removed from a node.
- 312.5 Kbaud transmission rate.
- Data is regenerated at each node.
- Two network ports to allow simultaneous connection to a fire alarm control panel and to a programming computer.
- Enables software and database upload/download over NOTI
- FIRE
- NET™.
- Repeaters are available to increase signal
- Repeaters may be utilized to switch media type
- Up to 1000m between nodes in a point-to-point fashion (actual distance varies with wire quality) NCM-W Interconnections: When wiring consecutive NCM-W boards, wiring may enter or exit at Port A or Port B. NCM-W port-to-port wiring is not polarity sensitive; use of Port A or Port B is arbitrary. An NCM-W may be connected to any of the following devices: MIB-W, MIB-WF and NCM-W (in another panel). NCM-F Features 
- Supports multi-mode fibre optic cable.
- Data is immune to all environmental noise.
- Optical isolation prevents ground loops.
- NOTI
- FIRE
- NET™ fibre-optic medium.
- Fibre type: 62.5/125 micrometers (multimode); or 50/125 micrometers (multimode).
- Maximum attenuation is 8 dB with 62.5/125 μm cable and 4.2dB with 50/125 μm cable.
- Wavelength: 820 nanometers (use standard 850 nm fibre)
- Connectors: ST® style
- 312.5 Kbaud transmission rate.
- Data is regenerated at each node.
- Two network ports to allow simultaneous connection to a fire alarm control panel and to a programming computer.
- Enables software and database upload/download over NOTI
- FIRE
- NET™. NCM-W NCM-F

The multi-mode fibre optic pair (RX, TX) from Port A of one node/repeater may be connected to either Port A or Port B of another node/repeater. An NCM-F may be connected to any of the following devices: MIB-F, MIB-W/F, another NCM-F, RPT-F, and RPT-WF. Common Specifications Temperature and humidity ranges: It is recommended that this system and all peripherals be installed in an environment with a nominal room temperature of 15˚C to 27˚C. Mixing Wire and Fibre on the same Network In some networks, it may be necessary to mix twisted-pair wire and multi-mode fibre optic cable. In these instances an RPT-WF may be used as an interface between wire and multi-mode fibre.Product Line Information NCM-W: Network Communications Module, twisted pair wire interface. NCM-F: Network Communications Module, multi-mode fibre-optic cable interface. NCM-SMOF: Network Communications Module, single-mode fibre-optic cable interface.
