- Increased home working means fewer occupants in commercial officesDrivers of Smart Building Growth Operational cost reduction and improved sustainability 
- Reduced energy consumption and carbon footprintFocus on Human Centric Design and Operation 
- Health, safety and wellbeing of occupants 
© Copyright Leviton Manufacturing Co., Inc. 6Building Systems are Transforming Traditional building systems were siloed and would not talk to each other Smart buildings: require these systems to work together and share dataConstruction contracts normally solicited proposals from separate MEP, AEC, Security and IT firmsEach OT system often had proprietary or special purpose “networks”

- There are many approaches to quantifying building performance 
- Each assessment program addresses a specific area: Energy, Sustainability, Safety, Connectivity, Cybersecurity, Health & Wellbeing 
- Improve your score and optimize outcomesBenchmarking / Setting Building Targets 
13 Identifying the Enabling Technologies 
- Traditional Building Automation Systems (BAS) are just a start 
- Purpose -built software integration platforms with AI continually improve system optimization 
- Keys to functionality: Data access, cross -platform compatibility, and system integration 
- Systems are moving from proprietary, stand -alone networks to IP -enabled platforms based on Ethernet connectivity
