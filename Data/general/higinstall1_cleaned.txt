 2-5Catalyst 3560 Switch Hardwa re Installation Guide OL-6337-07Sw itch Installation (24and 48-Port Switches) Preparing for Installation Statement 371—Power Cable and AC Adapter Caution To comply with the Telcordia GR-1089 Network Equipment Building Systems (NEBS) standard for electromagnetic compatibility and safety, connect the ethernet cables only to intrabuilding or nonexposed wiring or cabling. Caution To comply with the Telcordia GR-1089 NEBS standard, PoE or non-PoE 10/100/1000 Ethernet port cables that exit from either the left side or right side of the switch should be routed and tied to the nearest rack metal hardware. Note The grounding architecture of this product is DC-isolated (DC-I). Installation Guidelines When you determine where to place the switch, be sure to observe these requirements: The operating environment is w ithin the ranges listed in Appendix A, “Technical Specifications.” Airflow around the switch and through the vents is unrestricted. Clearance to front and rear panels meets these conditions: –You can easily read the front-panel indicators. –Access to ports is sufficien t for unrestricted cabling. –The rear-panel power connector is with in reach of an AC power receptacle. Temperature around the unit does not exceed 113°F (45°C). If the switch is installed in a closed or multirack assembly, the temperature around it might be greater than normal room temperature. Cabling is away from sources of electrical noise, such as radios, power lines, and fluorescent lighting fixtures. Make sure the cabling is safely away from other devices that might damage the cables. For copper Ethernet ports, including 10/100 ports, 10/100/1000 ports, and 1000BASE-T SFP module ports, cable lengths from the switch to conn ected devices can be up to 328 feet (100 meters). The cables meet th e specifications in Table B-1 on page B-4, which lists the cable specifications for 1000BASE-X and 100BASE-X SFP mo dules for the Cataly st 3560 switch. Ca talyst 3560 switch SFP ports use both GLC-GE-100XX and GLC-FE-100XX SFP modules. When you use shorter lengths of single-mode fiber cable, you might need to insert an inline optical attenuator in the link to avoid overloading the receiver. 
 2-6Catalyst 3560 Switch Hard ware Installation Guide OL-6337-07Switch Insta llation (24and 48-Port Switches) Verifying Switch Operation When the fiber-optic cable span is less than 15.43 mil es (25 km), you should insert a 5-decibel (dB) or 10-dB inline optical attenuator between the fibe r-optic cable plant and the receiving port on the 1000BASE-ZX SFP module at each end of the link. Cisco Ethernet Switches are equipped with cooling mechanisms, such as fans and blowers. However, these fans and blowers can draw dust and other particles, causing contaminant buildup inside the chassis, which can result in a system malfunction. You must install this equipment in an enviro nment as free as possibl e from dust and foreign conductive material (such as metal fl akes from construction activities). These standards provide guidelines for acceptable working environm ents and acceptable levels of suspended particulate matter: –Network Equipment Building Systems (NEBS) GR-63-CORE –National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) Type 1 –International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) IP-20 This applies to all Cisco Ethernet switches except for this compact model: –Catalyst 3560-8PC switch—8 10/100 PoE ports and 1 dual-purpose port (one 10/100/1000BASE-T copper port and one SFP module slot) Box Contents The switch getting started guide on Cisco.com describes the box contents. If any item is missing or damaged, contact your Cisco representative or reseller for support. Tools and Equipment You need to supply a number-2 Phillips screwdriver to rack-mount the switch. Verifying Switch Operation Before you install the switch in a rack, on a wall, or on a table or shelf, you should power the switch and verify that the switch passes POST. See Section 3, “Running Express Setup,” in the getting started guide for the steps required to connect a PC to the switch and to run Express Setup. If your configuration has an RPS, connect the switc h and the RPS to the same AC power source. See the “Cisco RPS” section on page 1-19, and see the Cisco RPS document ation for more information. Note When you connect the RPS to the switch, put the RPS in standby mode. Set the RPS to active mode during normal operation. To power on the switch, connect one end of the AC po wer cord to the AC power connector on the switch, and connect the other end of the power cord to an AC power outlet. Warning Attach only the following Cisco RPS model to the RPS receptacle: PWR-RPS2300, PWR675-AC-RPS-N1=. Statement 370
 2-7Catalyst 3560 Switch Hardwa re Installation Guide OL-6337-07Sw itch Installation (24and 48-Port Switches) Installing the Switch As the switch powers on, it begins the POST, a series of tests that runs automatically to ensure that the switch functions properly. LEDs can blink during the test. POST lasts approximately 1 minute. When the switch begins POST, the System, RPS, Status, Duplex, and Speed LEDs turn green. The System LED blinks green, and the other LEDs remain solid green. When the POST completes successfully, the Syst em LED remains green. The RPS LED remains green for some time and then reflects th e switch operating status. The other LEDs turn off and then reflect the switch operating status. If a switch fa ils POST, the System LED turns amber. POST failures are usually fatal. Call Cisco technica l support representative if your switch fails POST. Powering Off the Switch After a successful POST, disconnect the power cord from the switch.

If the attached ports do not support autonegotiation, you can explicitly set the speed and duplex parameters. Connecting devices that do not autonegoti ate or that have their speed and duplex parameters manually set can reduce performance or result in no linkage. Note You can configure duplex mode to half, full, or autone gotiate on Gigabit Ethernet interfaces if the speed is set to 10 or 100 Mb/s. You cannot configure half-duplex mode on Gigabit Ethernet interfaces if the interface speed is 1000 Mb/s. Warning Voltages that present a shock hazard may exist on Power over Ethernet (PoE) circuits if interconnections are made using uninsulated exposed metal contacts, conductors, or terminals. Avoid using such interconnection methods, unless the exposed metal parts are located within a restricted access location and users and service people who are authorized within the restricted access location are made aware of the hazard. A restricted access area can be accessed only through the use of a special tool, lock and key or other means of security. Statement 1072 To maximize performance, choose one of these methods for configuring the Ethernet ports: Let the ports autonegotiate both speed and duplex. Set the port speed and duplex parameters on both ends of the connection. You can configure the 10/100 or 10/100/1000 ports on the Catalyst 3560 PoE switches either to automatically provide PoE if a Cisco IP Phone, Cisco Aironet Access Point, or end device compliant with IEEE 802.3af is connected or to never provide PoE, even if an IP phone or an access point is connected. The default setting is Auto. To prevent electrostatic-discharge (ESD) damage, follow your normal board and component handling procedures. Caution PoE faults are caused when noncompliant cabling or powered devices are connected to a PoE port. Only standard-compliant cabling can be used to connect Cisco prestandard IP Phones or wireless access points or IEEE 802.3af-compliant devices to PoE ports. You must remove a cable or device that causes a PoE fault from the network. You can use the mdix auto interface configuration command in the CLI to enable the automatic medium-dependent interface cross over (auto-MDIX) feature. When th e auto-MDIX feature is enabled, the switch detects the required cable type for copper Ethernet connectio ns and configures the interfaces accordingly. Therefore, you can use either a crossove r or a straight-through cable for connections to a copper 10/100, 10/100/1000, or 1000BASE-T SFP module port on the sw itch, regardless of the type of device on the other end of the connection. The auto-MDIX feature is enabled by default on switches running Cisco IOS Release 12.2(18)SE or later. For releases between Cisco IOS Release 12.1( 14)EA1 and 12.2(18)SE, the auto-MDIX feature is disabled by default. For configuration information for this feature, see the switch software configuration guide or the switch command reference. 2-20Catalyst 3560 Switch Hard ware Installation Guide OL-6337-07Switch Insta llation (24and 48-Port Switches) Connecting the Switch to Compatible Devices The Catalyst 3560 switch can connect to a Cisco IP Phone through a straight-through, twisted four-pair Category 5 cable. The rear panel of the Cisco IP Phon e might have more than one RJ-45 connector. Use the LAN-to-phone connector to connect the IP phone to the switch. See the Cisco IP Phone documentation for more information about connecting devices. Many legacy powered devices, including older Cisco IP phones and access points that do not fully support IEEE 802.3af, might not su pport PoE when connected to th e switches by a crossover cable.
