IT infrastructure maintenance,"im one of a few network engineers for several hospitals in close proximity, and we are retrofitting one such hospital in the coming months upgrading aps and replacing with better switches to name two. we met with reps from nokia and were introduced to optical lan basically instead of copper in your lan, its fibre. all the infrastructure runs off olts and onts and would most likely involve installing an onu how big, i dont know? in a room with end devices, and the end devices would connect via ethernet to the onu, then fibre back to the olt. the benefits theyve said it would bring is less need to replace equipment, cheaper costs in the long run and less maintenance. now, ive worked in fibre before so i understood how it would all connect together. im just not sure of the benefit it would bring if the end devices are still connecting to the ont via ethernet, then via fibre back to the olt. we dont have the capacity neither to rip out all the old switches wed most likely leave the ethernet in the walls instead of pulling it and i do agree it sounds like a great idea, but i am just sceptical of the downsides and feel like were being fed half the picture. not sure of the benefit, as pcs and phones are still limited to 1gb100mb respectively and copper lan works just fine. yes, there are rare occasions where the cable would need to be replaced, but mainly due to how its been run and terminated at almost a 90 degree angle. from what i see, you run similar risks with fibre will almost never just naturally fail, but there is still a risk of contractors drilling through a wall and accidentally cutting a cable, at which point it would be a lot more work to replace the cable than it would be if it were copper. anybody had experience with optical lan? all my experience with fibre is on the wan side. || here we go again. pon is great at doing what its designed to do deliver broadband to your home, my home and millions of other homes. its awesome, we love it, there should be a religion forming around it. in the enterprise basically any infrastructure which is not about delivering service to millions of individual subscribers it absolutely sucks. handling multicast will be hell wifi roaming will be hell latency will not be consistent your pon installer will not understand networking, and will be clueless when your applications will not work. your application vendor will be clueless about pon and theyll just point fingers at it, and most of the time theyll be right. i work in the hospitality field, and the mantra of its cheap! its all passive! no idfs! its got lazers! has been harped on for years. and those who fell for it have all regretted it and already replaced it are in the process of replacing it with classic active ethernet. ps nokia is one of the few only? pon vendors who is really taking the enterprise market seriously and putting some serious development resources on getting it right, but having spoken to various nokia tech and nontech people, they still have a way to go before i would choose pon over active ethernet. || do you already have adequate structured cabling in this hospital? if you dont need to replace the copper cables then i honestly dont see any benefit to going with optical lan. if it was a new build you might save costs on running smaller amounts of fibre instead of copper from mdfs and idfs. but if you already have the copper cabling run, i doubt those nokia reps could give you a reason why optical makes sense. || do you mean fibre to the desk? was the sales rep a time traveling agent from the past? because ive not seen that for years. and its always a pain to migrate back to copper"
IT infrastructure maintenance,"have 2 remote sites lan interfaces connected over vpn through asa5508s. call them hq and branch. hq has standard dnsdhcp servers operating, providing services for local network clients as well as clients at branch clients. there are no servers and bare bones technical infrastructure at branch. only an asa, and a single access switch with clients connected. when we lose s2s connectivity, understandably the branch cant access local network services, but they also cant access the internet, even when their circuit is technically up. i believe this is a result of not reaching any dns source. i understand ideally wed use something like a rodc at the branch, but for the moment we are trying to quickly make them a little more resilient and less reliant on the tunnel, with some fast approaching major network maintenance scheduled. my plan is just to configure their asa to use some public dns as a tertiary option. i guess im just looking to make sure my idea of a configuration will work and should not cause another issue that im not anticipating. my approach would be asdm configuration device management dns dns client. leave primary and first secondary option as the 2 current local dns addresses. current config as that seems to be working as intended. then new config just add a 3rd option underneath. say on my ispoutside interface. the asa would only try to use that if the first 2 hq based addresses were nonresponsive to requests. is my thinkingplan valid? can anyone see any issues that would cause or reason it wouldnt work? i just want to cover my bases as well as possible before hand. i hate making potentially disruptive changes to the branch asa because that involves someone me driving out there to fix it if something goes south. || you need a local dns resolver that can do selective domain forwarding to the internal servers across the vpn and then just forward to quad9cloudflare or act as a recursive resolver whatever your preference for anything that hasnt been selectively overridden. a raspberry pi or two could be configured to do this... unfortunately i dont think the dns resolver in an asa is sophisticated enough to do selective domain overrides. im far from an asa expert so i could be wrong though... using a public resolver as the tertiary source on the asa at branch is a bad idea, since it could randomly cause problems for clients when the vpn is functional. || what are clients at the branch using as their dns? youre talking about setting up the fw to use external dns, what about the clients themselves? are those clients supposed to access any internal resources while s2s is working and that is why they are using dns from the hq? if that is the case, i really dont know if there is a way for this to work for you. afaik, asa cannot act as a dns proxy. || if i were in your shoes, i would set up a linux dns server on the branch to resolve to the main and internet, as well as a dhcp service and ntp. the problem with internet loss isnt just that you dont have dns, but also likely that the clients cant fetch addresses from the dhcp server since its remote as i understand it."
IT infrastructure maintenance,"i realize that hospitals and other kinds of facilities that would need a somewhat high maintenance network infrastructure will always exist. however, it does seem to be a net positive for many companies to get rid of their offices, even without cloud, and with on prem data centers instead. even then, many of those companies may deem switching to the cloud, as being more efficient anyway. while it is true that on prem data centers should be more secure in theory, and that can keep the demand going, but without worrying about branch offices and their connectivity needing to be maintained, a lot less work would be needed, especially on the layer 1 and 2 side. as a result the demand for that many network administrators would drop drastically, no? || i doubt youd see much of a drop if any. thered be a lower volume of onprem devicesinfrastructure to support, but there would still be some. but on the flipside thered then be a greater need for robust remote access solutions, take home devices, server infrastructure, general network securitysegmentation || banks, schools, universities, factories, government, entertainment facilities, etc. yea, a good bit of office building would shutter, but there is still a huge need for en. || each employee will need to connect somewhere, right? there you go with the zscalers, firewalls, vpn tunnels, etc."
IT infrastructure maintenance,"hello everyone, im looking for a field tester for fibers runs. the main usage would be troubleshooting and surveying on customer premises. the characteristics im interested in getting from those tests are length, loss, power and ultimately faults breaks, vfl. the constraints i have is that my team, incl. myself, arent fiber technicians. we are doing network refreshes and troubleshooting but no cabling installation or maintenance. we are mainly working on enterprisecampus and dc environments. the goal im trying to achieve is to be able to quickly check fibers characteristics onthego, as would an ethernet tester would do for copper and l2l7. this would especially useful in situations where the fiber installation hasnt any documentation andor the customer hasnt any knowledge of the fiber infrastructure this has happened more than once on factories type sites, and we cant afford to wait for a contractor to came and do full testing. also, because we often operate on brownfield deployments and on aging infrastructures, i would like to have a tool that can test both singlemode and multimode fibers. i have already looked at some testers such as exfo px1pro seems to support both sm and mm exfo maxtester 720c otdr with iolm software ? seems to support both sm and mm viavi tberdmts2000 with otdr module support sm wavelengths only fluke ofp2100q otdr support both sm and mm afl flexscan fs300 quad otdr seems to support both sm and mm trend network otdr ii support both sm and mm as i would submit the bom to my team leader, price is de facto a criteria so if i find a tool that isnt 10k likde the fluke or viavi, it would be better d i want to know what you guys use or recommend or think about this approach. thank you in advance. ps apologies for the doubtful english sentences as english isnt my primary language. || i have this and it does what its supposed to do. the shop is in germany. roughly 500 eur || iolm software for the exfo is their intelligent optical link mapper, it converts an otdr trace to a sequence of implied events. its not 100 accurate as its implying the event type by back reflectance, but if youre not adept at reading otdr traces it makes it easier. personally out of all these, i like exfo for otdrs the most. ive used a similar one to that afl and its decent, but if i had the budget id go exfo. see if you can find a local electrical supplier that carries exfo and afl and have them bring in the reps for each with a testdemo unit and run it on your actual live plant. make sure you see any related pc software as for something like this youll want to collect traces of all these paths over time, so when they break you can compare the two. || what distances are you looking to measure? some of the smaller meters are really nice because theyre ultra portable, but they usually dont have the dynamic range if you are looking to do 80120 km. ive got some exfo and veex otdrs that i use for longer spans, and believe it or not a cheap aliexpress otdr for the 60 km spans. the cheap otdr fits in my pocket and it has 20 db of dynamic range, so its good enough for troubleshooting inside plant and most metro deployments that i deal with. as far as the real test sets, i prefer the veex because it runs linux behind the gui, so its far less hassle for me to get it on the network to vnc into. the exfos typically run windows which causes a big headache for me. both have had good support though and have been fairly reliable."
IT infrastructure maintenance,"ive been tasked with migrating our existing internet edge infrastructure off of an old architecture involving 6 devices across 2 datacenters to a new architecture with only 2 devices across the 2 datacenters. that means at each datacenter location 3 devices are being consolidated into 1. old devices are cisco asrs, new ones are arista 7280sr3k of those 3 devices 2 have ebgp sessions with various ases ix and upstream isp transit and receive the full bgp table. they then send the best routes to the 3rd device over ibgp. the 3rd device also speaks osfp to all our internal devices and is the routing decision maker for internal traffic exiting our as. this means device 1 might have an ebgp session with asn 123 and device 2 might have an ebgp session with asn 456. i need to consolidate these sessions on the new device. ive done maintenances in the past, but never on the internet edge and never this complex, so im a bit nervous and overwhelmed to be honest. im trying to consolidate the configs of all these devices, removing deprecated config like route maps and neighborships between these devices, but its a lot to keep track of! ive finally got the physical layer connections figured out. the plan is to try and minimize the physical cable moves i need to do by connecting the new devices into the existing core and instead focus on just changing routing metrics to get the traffic to flow where it needs to go. this should also make rolling back easier if needed i feel confident in my plan for handling the ospf routing, setting up new sessions between existing pe devices and new edge, but with really bad metrics so no traffic flows towards the new devices, then slowly changing the metrics to drain and divert traffic but im not sure how to go about altering the bgp flows. i know i cant really influence how traffic comes into our network, only how it leaves, but i also dont know how much time i need for these changes to propagate. at a past place we always waited 30 mins after changing ospf metrics for the traffic to drain i also dont know how long it will take for the new devices to get the full bgp table when i move over the bgp sessions. i know i need to alert our ix and isp partners to the mac address changes for the new devices. there are just so many little things to keep track of! im trying to build a mop or a step by step guide to what were going to do, and what the rollback procedures are at each step, but its also a lot of work let alone testing that i wanted to do. im not exactly sure what i need to test beforehand or how to go about doing that without impacting current traffic in prod does anyone have any general advice from their experience doing larger maintences like this involving iedge devices? how much time should i be expecting things to take? any little gotchas to be aware of? what were the most difficult parts? || sounds like fun, i did a full sp core myself, borders and route reflectors, customers barely saw it. yes control your ingress and egress. as long as you have 23 or bigger your ok advertise the 23 and both 24. work on the link with the 24s since they can reroute to the 23 in provider networks quickly since the 23 doesnt fall out of the table. move the 23 to the moved link then do the other links just take your time, it took us a few hours to unstitch the router from the network, and then re attach the new. for egress you can do the same with default, or even a static if you want, then you can negate the bgp load time, its not to bad on newer kit. || honestly, it sounds like youre on the right track. you even found out with ix that you need to inform them of your updated mac, which isnt something i did when i swapped out a bgp router. it wasnt on their website like another ix provided in their faq!! we have a few ingressegress points with different ixs and peers. all i did was prepend our as to make it look not very good and monitor the traffic. the new bgp box had preconfigured settings to keep traffic looking awful, as verification on all links, neighbors, and igp was looking good. once verified, the prepends were removed to resume traffic. it didnt take long for traffic to ramp back up to expectations. good luck. its exciting. || i do stuff like this all the time. protip learn how to properly and cleanly influence your transitix traffic. something i will do is use things like 17410 community on cogent to have them reroute cleanly to a different preference route. almost every provider will have something like that that is cleaner than even just pretending or changing advertisements."
IT infrastructure maintenance,"i posted this before, but im realizing i needed to give a lot more details. im working for a company that has oil wells spread across several thousand acres of land. we are looking into the feasibility of a multiyear effort to fit all of the wells with various kinds of sensors and detectors, which will give us maintenance data a lot faster. im just posting here to get a general sense of the options that are out there. we will hire a network consultant at some point down the line, but for now im just putting together a presentation for the higher ups about this potential project, and i wanted to be able to add additional details about the technologies we would use and perhaps a very rough budget. i really dont know much about networking, so i apologize is advance for any dumb questions. i come humbly to the networking gods. i also thought this might be a fun problem for yall to think about, as its a pretty cool project. now, some details about the project the geography the oil wells are spread across about 150 different fields. they are all within a 30 mile x 30 mile square. the 150 fields are a lot of times adjacent to one another, but a lot of times noncontiguous. in total, there are around 2700 wells spread across the 150 field. within each field, the wells are laid out in a checkerboard pattern, with roughly one well per quarter acre about 100 ft apart, and they are usually more or less equidistant from one another. the oilfields are a mix of open fields and forestswamp. the wells are not always going to be visible above the tree line the vast majority of these wells are only about 712 feet tall. the wells dont necessarily have a direct line of site to each other. infrastructure the wells are all connected with a network of dirt roads. some of these roads are very cleared i.e., there are no trees hanging over them and some are pretty bad. all of the wells are also connected by a privately owned electrical grid, with power lines running along poles that connect all of the wells. usually the power lines follow the dirt roads. the company im sure when you think oilfield, you think a company that makes you think tons of money and can spend up the wazoo. the reality in this particular situation is that these oil wells are way beyond the peak level of production and are now each only producing minuscule amounts of oil. the thousand of wells together make up a decent amount of revenue, but its not like we can spend thousands of dollars of equipment on each well. were definitely going to be looking for the cheapest ways to do this on a per well basis.the devices we have not yet purchased the devices all part of the same project im scoping out. assume i can purchase ones that output any types of signal, as lots of different products exist out there. theres no 45g coverage. its very rural not even decent cell coverage. data in terms of the data wed be transmitting, most of our data requirements are pretty low. the sensors could send out a measurement each hour or something, and the latency doesnt matter much. that being said, if we do go through with all this, we may want to get security cameras on some of the highproducing wells. therefore, something that could support a live or not live, if that matters security feed would be dope. what is the best solution here? it sounds like the best solution will be some combination of a longerrange device like starlink for clusters of contiguous fields, and a network within each field of wells connecting to one another using either actual cables, lorawan, radio, or something else. thoughts? thank you in advance for any guidance! || look at lorawan for low cost, long range, low data throughput which sounds like a good fit for the well sensors. live video will be another matter and much more costly. if there are only a handful of high value wells, look at cambium microwave products for those sites. || check out gemds.com for orbit radios. you are probably looking at a licensed 400 or 900 mhz system.i do alot of work with the oils and gas industry just sending basic scada data. || super cool project, yes! what is the longest distance between a cluster of wells in two distant fields? where is the uplink to the main office or internet connection? i guess the same place as where electricity is injected into the grid? can you tell us a bit more about the iot stuff to be mounted on the wells? it sounds like a solution could be to run the sensorscameras from a battery backed up power over ethernet poe switches in the fields, so you only have to run a single cable from the switch and about 300ft to the sensor unit or camera at the well. think of the switch as the hub and the ethernet cables going out up to 300ft in all directions like spokes at the wells. it sounds like doing os2 fibre runs from the main officeuplink to individual fields along the existing electrical grid would be a good solution, also because the power lines and poles of the electrical grid are probably already known. the pattern stargridringtree of the electrical grid also determines how many meters of fiber has to be hung up in the poles to cover all the fields. i wouldnt worry too much about the security cameras. during normal usage, they do a good job of compressing real time feeds and you can normally switch from legoquality to full hd on demand just by switching the feeds url. what i would worry about is the environment the network equipment and sensors have to work under. when you write forestswamp im thinking high annualized temperature differences and high humidity. that could actually be the most expensive part of this project."

IT infrastructure maintenance,"tldr wanting to move away from ubiquiti. thoughts on mikrotik or pfsense netgate appliances for small business routers? hello everybody we are setting up a couple of remote offices in the spring and im reviewing our infrastructure decisions. in the past when weve setup remote offices, each office has been setup with edgerouter, edgeswitches, and unifi access points. due to issues with ubiquiti need i list everything, i want to switch away from ubiquiti. per very specific direction from our ceo, these remote offices need to be as independent as possible, we should not be involved in support, maintenance, updates, ect on a regular basis. so the more selfsustaining, the better. needs for the site are pretty limited. there are a few vlans 6, less than 50 clients total 1015 are wireless, and no sitetosite vpn sdwan site linking. its not required, but i would like to be able to setup the ability to vpn into the site not required, but would be nice for the rare time we need remote access for support. wan bandwidth utilization is 50mbps. for reference, our main office has sonicwall routers most likely changing to sophos in a year, aruba switches, and unifi aps evaluating switching to either aruba or ruckus. im still considering options, but right now im looking at a sophos xg firewall, aruba switches either 2530 or instanton the instanton switch has a local, web based management interface which looks like it supports everything we need we also get really good pricing on standard aruba so cost between them is pretty negligible, and aruba aps either standard aps in instant mode or instanton aps im pretty confident on the switch and ap choice open to feedback and other options i should consider, but im not sold on the router. thoughts on mikrotik which i have never used or pfsense ive used the software but it has been several years and not since netgate? are there other options i should consider? specifically less than 400500 tia! || even the lowest netgate appliance sg1100 can easily meet the requirements you listed. its also way easier for a newbie to configure than mikrotiks routeros. i do like mikrotik for the insane feature set they provide at such a low price point too though. when i had a similar need as yours to get multiple branch offices up and running quickly and for dirt cheap, i went with netgate sg3100s. each site had its own cable modem or fiber dia connection and i did routed ipsec tunnels back to hq to carry anything we didnt want reachable from the public internet. it was cake to set up and none of the sites ever had any issues except when their cable modem service had the occasional disruption. for the really problematic cable modem locations i added lte for backup. || honestly, a quasimanaged infrastructure might be best for low effortlow touch, a la meraki. not saying meraki is awesome, but for your use case it might be more than sufficient, and it handles firmware updatesetc. automatically if you configure it to do so. || netgate all the way."
