CHAPTER 1-1Catalyst 2950 Switch Hardware Installation Guide OL-6156-011 Overview This chapter provides information about these topics: Setting up the Switch, page 1-1 Features, page 1-1 Front-Panel Description, page 1-3 Rear-Panel Description, page 1-21 Management Options, page 1-24 Setting up the Switch See the Catalyst 2950 Switch Getting Started Guide for instructions on initially configuring your Catalyst switch by using the Express Setup. Also covered in the getting started guide are switch management options, basic rack-mounting procedures, port and module connections, power connection procedures for both ACand DC-powered switches, and troubleshooting help. For instructions on setting up your switch by using the command-line interface (CLI), see Appendix D, “Configuring the Switch with the CLI-Based Setup Program. ” Features The Catalyst 2950 switches are a family of Ethernet switches that you can use to connect workstations and other network devices, such as servers, routers, and other switches. All models of the switch are cluster-capable, but only some models are stackable. You can use switches with gigabit interface converter (GBIC) module slots to create switch stacks by using Gigastack GBICs. Some switch models can be deployed as backbone switches, aggregating 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, Gigabit Ethernet, and Long-Reach Ethernet (LRE) traffic from other switches and network devices. See the switch software configuration guide for examples that show how you might deploy the switches in your network. Figure 1-1 through Figure 1-12 show the Catalyst 2950 switches.

 1-8Catalyst 2950 Switch Hardware Installation Guide OL-6156-01Overview Front-Panel Description Note When connecting the switch to workstations, servers, and routers, be sure that the cable is a twisted-pair straight-through cable. When connecting the switch to hubs or other switches, use a twisted-pair crossover cable. Pinouts for the cables are described in Appendix B, “Connectors and Cables. ” For information on how to identify a crossover cable, go to the “Identifying a Crossover Cable ” section on page B-5. The 10/100 ports can be explicitly set to operate in any combination of half duplex, full duplex, 10 Mbps, or 100 Mbps. They can also be set for speed and duplex autonegotiation, compliant with IEEE 802.3U. In all cases, the cable length from a switch to an attached device cannot exceed 328 feet (100 meters). When set for autonegotiation, a port senses the speed and duplex settings of the attached device and advertises its own capabilities. If the attached device supports autonegotiation, the port negotiates the best connection (that is, the fastest line speed that both devices support and full-duplex transmission, if the attached device supports it) and configures itself accordingly. 10/100/1000 Ports The 10/100/1000 ports on Catalyst 2950T-24, Catalyst 2950T-48-SI, and Catalyst 2950 LRE switches use RJ-45 connectors and twisted-pair cabling. The ports can connect to these devices: 10BASE-T devices, such as workstations and hubs, through standard RJ-45 connectors and two or four twisted-pair, Category 5 cabling. 100BASE-TX devices, such as high-speed workstations, servers, hubs, routers, and other switches, through standard RJ-45 connectors and two or four twisted-pair, Category 5 cabling. 1000BASE-T devices, such as high-speed workstations, servers, hubs, routers, and other switches, through standard RJ-45 connectors and four twisted-pair, Category 5 cabling. Note When connecting the switch to a 1000BASE-T device, be sure to use a four twisted-pair, Category 5 cable. Note When connecting the switch to workstations, servers, and routers, be sure to use a twisted-pair straight-through cable. When connecting the switch to hubs or other switches, use a twisted-pair crossover cable. Pinouts for the cables are described in Appendix B, “Connectors and Cables. ” For information on how to identify a crossover cable, go to the “Identifying a Crossover Cable ” section on page B-5. The 10/100/1000 ports on the Catalyst 2950T-24 switch can be explicitly set to operate at 10, 100, or 1000 Mbps, but only in full-duplex mode. The 10/100/1000 ports on the Catalyst 2950T-48-SI and Catalyst 2950 LRE switches can be explicitly set to operate at 10 or 100 Mbps in fullor half-duplex mode or at 1000 Mbps in full-duplex mode. The 10/100/1000 ports can also be set for speed autonegotiation, compliant with IEEE 802.3AB. In all cases, the cable length from a switch to an attached device cannot exceed 328 feet (100 meters).
 1-9Catalyst 2950 Switch Hardware Installation Guide OL-6156-01Overview Front-Panel Description Note On the Catalyst 2950 LRE switches, the four input uplink ports are bundled as two logical ports, each consisting of a copper 10/100/1000 port and a fiber-optic SFP module slot, respectively. Within each logical port, you can use only the copper or the fiber-optic port at one time. If a Catalyst 2950 LRE switch senses more than two connections for both logical ports, the switch chooses the fiber-optic connections over the copper connections in default operation. See the “SFP Module Slots ” section on page 1-11 for more information on LRE uplink logical ports. 100BASE-FX and 1000BASE-SX Ports The 100BASE-FX and 1000BASE-SX ports both use 50/125or 62.5/125-micron multimode fiber-optic cabling. The 100BASE-FX ports operate only at 100 Mbps in full-duplex mode, and the 1000BASE-SX ports operate only at 1000 Mbps in full-duplex mode. In full-duplex mode, the cable length from a 100BASE-FX port on a switch to an attached device cannot exceed 6562 feet (2 kilometers). The cable length from a 1000BASE-SX port on a switch to an attached device cannot exceed 1804 feet (550 meters). You can connect a 100BASE-FX or 1000BASE-SX port to an SC or ST port on a target device by using one of the MT-RJ fiber-optic patch cables listed in Table 2-1 on page 2-29. Use the Cisco part numbers in Table 2-1 to order the patch cables that you need. LRE Port The LRE port (shown in Figure 1-8 ) uses one RJ-21 connector to connect up to 24 Cisco LRE CPE devices through structured or unstructured wiring, such as existing telephone lines. The link between the LRE switch port and each CPE device can reach speeds of up to 15 Mbps (full duplex) over distances of up to 4921 feet (1500 meters). Certain Catalyst 2950 LRE switches support certain Cisco LRE CPE devices. Table 1-1 on page 1-3 shows which LRE switches support which CPE devices. You can connect the Cisco 575 LRE CPE and Cisco 585 LRE CPE devices to LRE ports on the same Catalyst 2950ST-8 LRE or 2950ST-24 LRE switch. You can connect the Cisco 576 LRE CPE 997 device only to LRE ports on a Catalyst 2950ST-24 LRE 997 switch. You can hot swap the CPE devices without powering down the switch or disrupting the other switch ports. The default mode for each LRE port is speed autosensing and half-duplex operation. For information about configuring the LRE ports, see the switch software configuration guide. If telephone services, such as voice or an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), use the same cabling as LRE traffic, the LRE port must be connected to the patch panel through a plain old telephone service ( POTS) splitter. The splitter routes LRE data (high-frequency) and voice (low-frequency) traffic from the telephone line to the switch and private branch exchange (PBX) switch or public switched telephone network (PSTN). If the other telephone services are connected through a PBX switch, a non-homologated POTS splitter, such as the Cisco LRE 48 POTS Splitter, can be used. The PBX routes voice traffic to private telephone networks and the PSTN. For more information about the Cisco LRE 48 POTS Splitter (PS-1M-LRE-48), see the Installation and Warranty Notes for the Cisco LRE 48 POTS Splitter. 1-10Catalyst 2950 Switch Hardware Installation Guide OL-6156-01Overview Front-Panel Description For limitations and restrictions when you use a POTS splitter with the Catalyst 2950 LRE switches and Cisco LRE CPE, see the “Limitations and Restrictions with POTS Splitters ” section on page 2-31. If the installation does not have a PBX, a certified, homologated POTS splitter is required to connect directly to the PSTN. For more information about homologated POTS splitters, contact your Cisco sales representative. If a connection to a telephone network is not required, a splitter is not needed, and the switch can connect directly to the patch panel. For more information about the Cisco LRE CPE devices, see the Cisco LRE CPE Hardware Installation Guide. GBIC Module Ports The GBIC module slots support these modules: 1000BASE-SX GBIC module for fiber-optic connections that cannot exceed 1804 feet (550 meters). 1000BASE-LX/LH GBIC module for fiber-optic connections that cannot exceed 32,810 feet (10 kilometers). 1000BASE-ZX GBIC module for fiber-optic connections that cannot exceed 328,100 feet (100 kilometers). 1000BASE-T GBIC module for copper connections that cannot exceed 328 feet (100 meters). CWDM GBIC module for single-mode fiber-optic connections that cannot exceed 393,719 feet (120 kilometers). GigaStack GBIC module for creating a 1-Gbps stack configuration of up to nine supported switches. The GigaStack GBIC supports one full-duplex link (in a point-to-point configuration) or up to nine half-duplex links (in a stack configuration) to other Gigabit Ethernet devices. Using the required Cisco proprietary signaling and cabling, the GigaStack GBIC-to-GigaStack GBIC connection cannot exceed 3 feet (1 meter). Note Cisco-approved CWDM GBIC modules have a serial EEPROM that contains the module serial number, the vendor name and ID, a unique security code, and cyclic redundancy check (CRC). When a GBIC module is inserted in the switch, the switch software reads the EEPROM to check the serial number, vendor name, and vendor ID and recomputes the security code and CRC. If the serial number, the vendor name or ID, security code, or CRC is invalid, the switch places the interface in an error-disabled state. Note If you are using a non-Cisco approved CWDM GBIC module, remove the module from the switch, and replace it with a Cisco-approved module. For more information about these GBIC modules, see your GBIC module documentation.
 1-11Catalyst 2950 Switch Hardware Installation Guide OL-6156-01Overview Front-Panel Description SFP Module Slots On the Catalyst 2950 LRE switch, the SFP module slots support the SFP modules listed in the Catalyst 2950 LRE switch release notes. The Catalyst 2950 LRE switch has four physical input ports that are logically bundled as two ports. Each logical port consists of a copper 10/100/1000 port and a fiber-optic SFP module slot. These ports appear as a vertical column on the front panel and are labeled Uplink Port 1 and Uplink Port 2. Within each port, you can use only one of the two physical ports, either the SFP module port or the 10/100/1000 port. For example, you can connect to either the SFP module port or the 10/100/1000 port on Uplink Port 1. If you connect to both, in default operation, the SFP module port has priority over the 10/100/1000 port. Using this example, a valid configuration would be connecting to the fiber-optic port on Uplink Port 1 and the copper port on Uplink Port 2. Note By using the media-type {sfp | rj45 | auto-select } interface configuration command at the CLI, you can configure the Catalyst 2950 LRE switch so that the SFP module port does not take precedence over the 10/100/1000 port. In that scenario, whichever media type establishes a link first has precedence over the other. For more information about the media-type {sfp | rj45 | auto-select } command, see the switch command reference. SFP Modules The LRE switches use Ethernet SFP modules to establish uplink connections to other devices. The SFP modules are inserted into SFP module slots on the front of the Catalyst 2950 LRE switches. These transceiver modules are field-replaceable. You use fiber-optic cables with LC or MT-RJ connectors to connect to fiber-optic SFP modules. You use Category 5 cable with RJ-45 connectors to connect to 1000BASE-T SFP modules. The SFP modules support nominal wavelengths from 850 to 1550 nanometers (nm). See the Catalyst 2950 LRE switch release notes for the list of supported SFP modules. When determining where to place the switch, be sure to observe these requirements: For 10/100/1000 ports, including 1000BASE-T SFP module ports, cable lengths from the switch to connected devices are up to 328 feet (100 meters). Table 1-2 lists the cable specifications for 1000BASE-SX, 1000BASE-LX, and 1000BASE-ZX fiber-optic SFP module connections. Each port must match the wave-length specifications on the other end of the cable, and for reliable communications, the cable must not exceed the stipulated cable length.
 1-12Catalyst 2950 Switch Hardware Installation Guide OL-6156-01Overview Front-Panel Description Note When using shorter distances of single-mode fiber cable, you might need to insert an inline optical attenuator in the link to avoid overloading the receiver. When the fiber-optic cable span is less than15.43 miles (25 km), you should insert a 5-decibel (dB) or 10-dB inline optical attenuator between the fiber-optic cable plant and the receiving port on the 1000BASE-ZX SFP module at each end of the link. Use only Cisco-approved SFP modules on the Catalyst 2950 LRE switch. Note Cisco-approved SFP modules have a serial EEPROM that contains the module serial number, the vendor name and ID, a unique security code, and cyclic redundancy check (CRC). When an SFP module is inserted in the switch, the switch software reads the EEPROM to check the serial number, vendor name, and vendor ID and recomputes the security code and CRC. If the serial number, the vendor name or ID, security code, or CRC is invalid, the switch places the interface in an error-disabled state. Note If you are using a non-Cisco approved SFP module, remove the module from the switch, and replace it with a Cisco-approved module. For more information about these SFP modules, see your SFP module documentation.T able 1-2 Fiber-Optic SFP Module Port Cabling Specifications SFP ModuleWavelength (nanometers) Fiber TypeCore Size (micron)Modal Bandwidth (MHz/km) Cable Distance 1000BASE-SX 850 MMF 62.5 62.55050160 200400500722 feet (220 m) 902 feet (275 m)1640 feet (500 m)1804 feet (550 m) 1000BASE-LX/LH 1300 MMF 1 SMF 1.

You can order a kit (part number ACS-DSBUASYN=) with that adapter from Cisco. Verifying Switch Operation Before installing the switch in a rack, on a wall, or on a table or shelf, you should power on the switch and verify that the switch passes POST. See Section 3, “Running Express Setup, ” in the getting started guide for the steps required to connect a PC to the switch console port and to power on the switch. While the switch powers on, it automatically begins POST, a series of tests that verifies that the switch functions properly. When the switch begins POST, the system LED is off. POST has completed successfully when the SYST and STAT LEDs are green. If a switch fails POST, the System LED turns amber. If POST fails, see , “Troubleshooting, ” to determine a course of action. Note POST failures are usually fatal. Call Cisco Systems if your switch does not pass POST. After a successful POST, follow these steps: Step 1 Turn off power to the switch. Step 2 Disconnect the cables. Step 3 Determine where you want to install the switch.

SFP modules are inserted into SFP module slots on the front of the Catalyst 2950 LRE switches. These field-replaceable modules provide the uplink interfaces. You can use any combination of SFP modules. See the Catalyst 2950 LRE release notes for the list of SFP modules that the Catalyst 2950 LRE switch supports. Each port must match the wave-length specifications on the other end of the cable, and for reliable communications, the cable must not exceed the stipulated cable length. Refer to Table 1-2 for cable stipulations for SFP module connections. Use only Cisco SFP modules on the Catalyst 2950 LRE switch. Each SFP module has an internal serial EEPROM that is encoded with security information. This encoding provides a way for Cisco to identify and validate that the SFP module meets the requirements for the switch. For detailed instructions on installing, removing, and cabling the SFP module, refer to your SFP module documentation. Installing SFP Modules into SFP Module Slots SFP modules use different types of latches for their installation and extraction. Determine which type of latch your SFP module uses before following the installation procedure: Figure 2-28 shows an SFP module with a Mylar tab latch. Figure 2-29 shows an SFP module with an actuator button latch. Figure 2-30 shows an SFP module that has a bale-clasp latch. Caution We strongly recommend that you do not install or remove the SFP module with fiber-optic cables attached to it because of the potential damage to the cables, the cable connector, or the optical interfaces in the SFP module. Disconnect all cables before removing or installing an SFP module. Removing and installing an SFP module can shorten its useful life. Do not remove and insert SFP modules more often than is absolutely necessary.Catalyst 2950 SERIES 1 2 74533Metal flap door GBIC module slot GigaStack GBIC module

The 10/100/1000 ports on Catalyst 2950 LRE and Catalyst 2950T-48-SI switches operate at 10 or 100 Mbps in either halfor full-duplex mode and at 1000 Mbps only in full-duplex mode. If the attached devices do not support autonegotiation, you can set the speed. Note On the Catalyst 2950 LRE switches, the four input uplink ports are bundled as two logical ports, each consisting of a copper 10/100/1000 port and a fiber-optic SFP module slot, respectively. Within each logical port, you can use only the copper or the fiber-optic port at one time. If the Catalyst 2950 LRE switch senses more than two connections for both logical ports, by default, the switch chooses the fiber-optic connections over the copper connections. See the “SFP Module Slots ” section on page 1-11 for more information on LRE uplink logical ports. Connecting devices that do not autonegotiate or devices with manually set speed and duplex parameters can reduce performance or result in link failures between the devices. To maximize performance, choose one of these methods for configuring the ports: Let the 10/100 ports autonegotiate both speed and duplex, let the 10/100/1000 ports on the LRE switches autonegotiate both speed and duplex, and let the 10/100/1000 ports on the Catalyst 2950G-24-EI-DC switch only autonegotiate speed. Set the speed and duplex parameters on both ends of the connection. When connecting the ports on the Catalyst 2950G-24-EI-DC and Catalyst 2950ST-24 LRE 997 switches to other devices, follow these guidelines: Caution To comply with the intrabuilding lightning surge requirements, intrabuilding wiring must be shielded, and the shield for the wiring must be grounded at both ends. Caution The Catalyst 2950G-24-EI-DC or Catalyst 2950ST-24 LRE 997 switch is suitable only for intrabuilding or nonexposed wiring connections. Follow these steps to connect the switch to 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, or 1000BASE-T devices: Caution To prevent electrostatic-discharge (ESD) damage, follow your normal board and component handling procedures.

 2-30Catalyst 2950 Switch Hardware Installation Guide OL-6156-01Installation Connecting to an LRE Port The LED turns amber while STP discovers the network topology and searches for loops. This process takes about 30 seconds, and then the port LED turns green. If the LED is off, the target device might not be turned on, there might be a cable problem, or there might be a problem with the adapter installed in the target device. See , “Troubleshooting, ” for solutions to cabling problems. Step 5 Reconfigure and restart the target device if necessary. Step 6 Repeat Steps 1 through 5 to connect each port. Connecting to an LRE Port Depending on the switch model, you can connect the LRE port to up to 8 or up to 24 LRE customer premises equipment (CPE) devices through a patch panel. For information about which LRE CPE devices are supported by the LRE switches, see Table 1-1 on page 1-3. Note You can connect both Cisco 575 LRE CPE and Cisco 585 LRE CPE devices to your Catalyst 2950ST-8 LRE or Catalyst 2950ST-24 LRE switch. You can connect only the Cisco 576 LRE CPE 997 device to LRE ports on a Catalyst 2950ST-24 LRE 997 switch. You can hot swap the CPE devices without powering down the switch or disrupting the other switch ports. Connection Guidelines If telephone services, such as voice or Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), use the same cabling as the LRE traffic, you must connect the LRE to a plain old telephone service (POTS) splitter. The splitter routes LRE data (high-frequency) and voice (low-frequency) traffic from the telephone line to the switch and private branch exchange (PBX) switch or public switched telephone network (PSTN). If the other telephone services are connected through a PBX switch, you can use a Cisco LRE 48 POTS Splitter. The PBX routes voice traffic to private telephone networks and the PSTN. For more information about the Cisco LRE 48 POTS Splitter (PS-1M-LRE-48), see the Installation and Warranty Notes for the Cisco LRE 48 POTS Splitter. If the installation does not have a PBX, you need to use a homologated POTS splitter to connect to the PSTN. For more information about homologated POTS splitters, contact your Cisco sales representative. If a connection to a telephone network is not required, you do not need a splitter, and you can connect the switch to the patch panel.
 2-31Catalyst 2950 Switch Hardware Installation Guide OL-6156-01Installation Connecting to an LRE Port Limitations and Restrictions with POTS Splitters These limitations and restrictions apply when you use a POTS splitter with Catalyst 2950 LRE switches and Cisco LRE CPE devices: The Catalyst 2950ST-8 LRE switch, Catalyst 2950ST-24 LRE switch, Cisco 575 LRE CPE, and Cisco 585 LRE CPE are designed to share lines with analog, ISDN, and digital PBX switch telephones that use the 0 to 700 kHz frequency range. Digital telephones connected to digital PBX switches that use frequencies above 700 kHz do not work when sharing a line with LRE signals. Due to the proprietary nature of digital PBX switches, some digital PBX switch services use frequencies above 700 kHz. You can use a Cisco LRE 48 POTS Splitter with a Catalyst 2950ST-8 LRE switch, Catalyst 2950ST-24 LRE switch, Cisco 575 LRE CPE, and Cisco 585 LRE CPE. For installation instructions, see the Installation and Warranty Notes for the Cisco LRE 48 POTS Splitter. The Catalyst 2950ST-24 LRE 997 switch and Cisco 576 LRE 997 CPE are designed to share lines with analog and ISDN telephones that use the 0 to 120 kHz frequency range. We recommend that you do not use a Cisco LRE 48 POTS Splitter with a Catalyst 2950ST-24 LRE 997 switch and a Cisco 576 LRE 997 CPE as shown in Figure 2-37. Only traffic in a specific frequency range can be sent to and from the devices attached to the CPE. In Figure 2-37, only traffic from 0 to 120 kHz can pass from a device attached to the CPE, such as a computer or telephone, to the CPE, a splitter, and a switch. In the reverse direction, traffic from 0 to 700 kHz can pass through the switch and splitter to the CPE, but only traffic from 0 to 120 kHz can pass through the CPE to a computer or a telephone. For more information, see the Installation and Warranty Notes for the Cisco LRE 48 POTS Splitter.

Where to Go Next For information about starting up the switch, see the Catalyst 2950 Switch Getting Started Guide. If the default configuration is satisfactory, the switch does not need further configuration. You can use any of these management options to change the default configuration: Start the device manager, which is in the switch memory, to manage individual and standalone switches. This is an easy-to-use web interface that offers quick configuration and monitoring. You can access the device manager from anywhere in your network through a web browser. For more information, see the device manager online help. Start the Network Assistant application, which is described in the Getting Started with Cisco Network Assistant guide. Through this GUI, you can configure and monitor a switch cluster or an individual switch. Use the CLI from the console to configure the switch as a member of a cluster or as an individual switch. See the Catalyst 2950 and Catalyst 2955 Switch Software Configuration Guide and the Catalyst 2950 and Catalyst 2955 Switch Command Reference on Cisco.com for more information. For setup instructions that use the CLI, go to Appendix D, “Configuring the Switch with the CLI-Based Setup Program. ” Start an SNMP application such as the CiscoView application. For information about configuring the switch, see the switch software configuration guide.

CHAPTER 3-1Catalyst 2950 Switch Hardware Installation Guide OL-6156-013 Troubleshooting The front-panel LEDs provide troubleshooting information about the switch. They show power-on self-test (POST) failures, port-connectivity problems, and overall switch performance. For a full description of the LEDs, see the “LEDs ” section on page 1-13. You can also get statistics from the device manager, the Network Assistant application, the CLI, the Cisco Intelligence Engine 2100 (IE2100) Series Configuration Registrar, or a SNMP workstation. See the switch software configuration guide, the switch command reference, or the documentation that came with your IE2100 or SNMP application for details. This chapter provides these topics for troubleshooting problems: Understanding POST Results, page 3-1 Diagnosing Problems, page 3-1 Understanding POST Results When the switch powers on, it automatically begins POST, a series of tests that verifies that the switch functions properly. When the switch begins POST, the system LED is off. POST has completed successfully when the SYST and STAT LEDs are green. Note POST failures are usually fatal. Call Cisco Systems if your switch does not pass POST.

 B-1Catalyst 2950 Switch Hardware Installation Guide OL-6156-01APPENDIX B Connectors and Cables This appendix describes the connectors, cables, and adapters that you use to connect the switch to other devices. Connector Specifications These sections describe the connectors used with the Catalyst 2950 switches and contains this information: 10/100 Ports, page B-1 10/100/1000 Ports, page B-2 100BASE-FX and 1000BASE-SX Ports, page B-4 LRE Port, page B-3 GigaStack GBIC Module Ports, page B-4 SFP Module Ports, page B-5 Console Port, page B-5 10/100 Ports The 10/100 Ethernet ports use standard RJ-45 connectors and Ethernet pinouts with internal crossovers, as shown by an X in the port name. These ports have the transmit (TD) and receive (RD) signals internally crossed so that a twisted-pair straight-through cable and adapter can be attached to the port. Figure B-1 shows the pinout. When connecting 10/100 ports to other devices, such as servers, workstations, and routers, you can use a two or four twisted-pair, straight-through cable wired for 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX. Figure B-10 shows the two twisted-pair, straight-through cable schematics. Figure B-12 shows the four twisted-pair, straight-through cable schematics. When connecting the ports to other devices, such as switches or repeaters, you can use a two or four twisted-pair, crossover cable. Figure B-11 shows the two twisted-pair, crossover cable schematics. Figure B-13 shows the four twisted-pair, crossover cable schematics. You can use Category 3, 4, or 5 cabling when connecting to 10BASE-T devices. You must use Category 5 cabling when connecting to 100BASE-TX devices.
 B-2Catalyst 2950 Switch Hardware Installation Guide OL-6156-01Appendix B Connectors and Cables Connector Specifications Note Use a straight-through cable to connect two ports only when one port is designated with an X. Use a crossover cable to connect two ports when both ports are designated with an X or when both ports do not have an X. Figure B-1 10/100 RJ-45 Pinouts 10/100/1000 Ports The 10/100/1000 Ethernet ports on Catalyst 2950T-24, Catalyst 2950T-48-SI, and Catalyst 2950 Long-Reach Ethernet (LRE) switches use standard RJ-45 connectors. Figure B-2 shows the pinout. Note On the Catalyst 2950 LRE switches, the four input uplink ports are bundled as two logical ports, each consisting of a copper 10/100/1000 port and a fiber-optic small form-factor pluggable (SFP) module slot, respectively. Within each logical port, you can use only the copper or the fiber-optic port at one time. If the Catalyst 2950 LRE switch senses more than two connections for both logical ports, the switch chooses the fiber-optic connections over the copper connections in default operation. See the “SFP Module Slots ” section on page 1-11 for more information on LRE uplink logical ports. Connecting to 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX Devices When connecting the ports to 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX devices, such as servers, workstations, and routers, you can use a two or four twisted-pair, straight-through cable wired for 10BASE-T and100BASE-TX. Figure B-10 shows the two twisted-pair, straight-through cable schematics. Figure B-12 shows the four twisted-pair, straight-through cable schematics. When connecting the ports to 10BASE-Tand 100BASE-TX devices, such as switches or repeaters, you can use a two or four twisted-pair, crossover cable. Figure B-11 shows the two twisted-pair, crossover cable schematics. Figure B-13 shows the four twisted-pair, crossover cable schematics. You can use Category 3, 4, or 5 cabling when connecting to 10BASE-T devices. You must use Category 5 cabling when connecting to 100BASE-TX devices.

Figure B-14 shows the straight-through cable schematics. When connecting the ports to other devices, such as switches or repeaters, you must use a four twisted-pair, Category 5, crossover cable. Figure B-15 shows the crossover cable schematics. Note Be sure to use a four twisted-pair, Category 5 cable when connecting to a 1000BASE-T device. Note Use a straight-through cable to connect two ports only when one port is designated with an X. Use a crossover cable to connect two ports when both ports are designated with an X or when both ports do not have an X. Figure B-2 RJ-45 Pinouts for 10/100/1000 and 1000BASE-T GBIC Module Ports LRE Port The LRE port uses a single 50-pin RJ-21 connector, as shown in Figure B-3. Each LRE port uses two pins. Because the Catalyst 2950ST-24 LRE and Catalyst 2950ST-24 LRE 997 switches use 48 pins, pin 25 on the top row and pin 50 on the bottom row are not used The Catalyst 2950ST-8 LRE switch uses 16 pins. Pins 9 through 25 on the top row and pins 34 through 50 on the bottom row are not used. Figure B-3 RJ-21 Connector12345678Pin Label 1 2345678TP0+ TP0-TP1+TP2+TP2-TP1-TP3+TP334751 1 2625 509 34 97734

These ports use 50/125or 62.5/125-micron multimode fiber-optic cabling. You can connect a 100BASE-FX or 1000BASE-SX port to an SC or ST port on a target device by using one of the MT-RJ fiber-optic patch cables listed in Table 2-1 on page 2-29. Use the Cisco part numbers in Table 2-1 to order the patch cables that you need. Figure B-4 MT -RJ Connector 1000BASE-X GBIC Module Ports 1000BASE-X Gigabit Interface Converter (GBIC) module ports use duplex SC connectors, as shown in Figure B-5. Figure B-5 1000BASE-X SC Connector 1000BASE-T GBIC Module Ports The 1000BASE-T GBIC module port uses one RJ-45 connector, as shown in Figure B-2. GigaStack GBIC Module Ports The GigaStack GBIC module ports use proprietary connectors, as shown in Figure B-6. The GigaStack GBIC cables are proprietary, high-data-rate cables with enhanced signal integrity and EMI protection. Caution Do not use standard IEEE 1394 cables with the GigaStack GBIC.

See the Catalyst 2950 LRE switch release notes for a list of supported SFP modules. See Figure B-7 and Figure B-8. Figure B-7 Fiber-Optic SFP Module LC Connector Warning Invisible laser radiation may be emitted from disconnected fibers or connectors. Do not stare into beams or view directly with optical instruments. Statement 1051 Figure B-8 1000BASE-T SFP Module RJ-45 Connector Console Port The console port uses an 8-pin RJ-45 connector. You can connect a switch to a PC through the console port and the supplied RJ-45-to-DB-9 adapter cable. If you want to connect a switch to a terminal, you need to provide an RJ-45-to-DB-25 female DTE adapter. You can order a kit (part number ACS-DSBUASYN=) with that adapter from Cisco. For console-port and adapter-pinout information, see Table B-3 and Table B-4. Identifying a Crossover Cable You can identify a crossover cable by comparing the two modular cable ends. Hold the cable ends side-by-side, with the tab at the back. The wire connected to the pin on the outside of the left plug should be the same color as the wire connected to the pin on the outside of the right plug.
