Fundamental terminology
© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveAutonomous system (AS) 
- An Autonomous System (AS) is a set of Internet routable IP prefixes belonging to a network or a collection of networks that are all managed, controlled, and supervised by a single entity or organization. 
- An AS utilizes a common routing policy controlled by the entity BRKMPL -2103 6
© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveASN (Autonomous System Number) 
- The AS is assigned a globally unique 32bits number (0 -4294967295) identification number by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). 
- The 64512 to 65535 range and above 4.2B is reserved for private use 
- Remaining ASes are available by IANA for global use. Registration needed. 
- Autonomous Systems were introduced to regulate networking organizations such as Internet Service Providers (ISP), educational institutions and government agencies. 
- AS ownership information is publicly available. 7 BRKMPL -2103
BGP Basics 
© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveBorder Gateway Protocol (BGP) 
- The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an Inter Autonomous System routing protocol (RFC 4271). 
- The primary function of a BGP speaking system is to exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems in scalable and robust way. 
- BGP is decoupled from the IGP (It runs on top of the IGP). Peering always between two routers via explicit config. 
- A BGP session runs over a TCP session port 179. The peering address must be reachable through the IGP or directly connected. 
- Peers do not need to be directly connected. For example in below network both BGP peer are not connected directly. 9 BRKMPL -2103 10.1.1.1 20.1.1.1router bgp100 bgprouter -id 10.1.1.1 address -family ipv4 unicast neighbor 20.1.1.1 remote -as 100 update -source Loopback0 address -family ipv4 unicastrouter bgp100 bgprouter -id 20.1.1.1 address -family ipv4 unicast neighbor 10.1.1.1 remote -as 100 update -source Loopback0 address -family ipv4 unicast

Tries to initiate TCP connection with peers and listens for other TCP connections. 2.Connect: BGP is waiting for the TCP connection to be completed 3.Active: BGP is trying to acquire a peer by listening for, and accepting, a TCP connection. 4.Open Sent: Open sent message has been sent and is waiting for peers open message 5.Open confirm: Waiting for peers keep alive or notification. 6.Established: Session ready to use and ready to exchange routes
© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveBGP NLRI (Network Layer Reachability Information) 
- NLRI is key in the local database for network/mask -> this created the parent network 
- unique NLRI received from a neighbor creates a path 
- One network linked to multiple (path/ nbr) 
- attributes are properties of a (path/ nbr) 
- AFI/SAFI (address -family/sub -address -family) 
- Originally, BGP was intended for routing of IPv4 prefixes between organizations 
- RFC4760 added Multi -Protocol BGP (MP -BGP) capability by adding extensions called address -family identifier (AFI) 
- An address -family correlates to a specific network protocol, such as IPv4, IPv6, VPNv4, VPNv6 and additional granularity through a subsequent address -family identifier (SAFI), such as unicast, labeled and multicast. 12 BRKMPL -2103

© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveBGP Attributes (most used) 
- AS Path: sequence of ASes the route has traversed 
- MP_REACH (14)/MP_UNREACH(15) 
- Next_Hop attribute (by itself for ipv4, otherwise in MP_REACH) 
- Do not change in iBGP updates 
- It is the forwarding gateway. We may need a recursive lookup 
- Multi_EXIT_DISC: metric set on EBGP (better = lower) 
- Local Preference: degree of preference (better = higher) announced to IBGP 
- Community: arbitrary number for prefixes sharing common property, for policy control 
- Attributes are: - Optional: transitive or non -transitive 
- Well-known: mandatory or discretionary 14 BRKMPL -2103
© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveExternal BGP vs Internal BGP 
- IBGP session is formed between neighbors within the same AS 
- EBGP is formed between neighbors in different AS. 
- A route learnt from an IBGP peer will not be advertised back to another IBGP by default. 
- Exception: special iBGP Route -Reflector role 
- Routes received from an EBGP peer can be advertised to EBGP and IBGP peers 
- Local AS is not prepended to the AS path when advertised to an IBGP peer. 
- Local preference attribute is sent to the IBGP peers but not to an EBGP peer. 15 BRKMPL -2103

Layer 3 Virtual Private Network L3VPN
© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveL3VPN in a Nutshell 
- Customers exchange routes with the provider 
- A routing protocol runs between the customer (CE) and ISP (PE) 
- The provider isolates the customer A routes from other customer B routes using Route -Distinguisher, VPN label and MPLS transport across their core. 
- The routes are then provided to each customer site via an CE -PE routing protocols and the customer makes their own routing decisions 
- “VPN” is isolation, not security. No inherent encryption/confidentiality in the provider's cloud 22 BRKMPL -2103
© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveL3VPN moving parts 
- The Core: 
- MP-BGP between PEs 
- IGP: mainly ISIS or OSPF routing between core PEs 
- Label transport options: LDP, RSVP/TE, Segment -Routing IGP, SR -TE policy 
- The Edge: - Anyrouting protocol between the PE and CE 23 BRKMPL -2103 PE PE CE CE P 
© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveVRF Overview 
- VRF = VPN Routing Forwarding instance 
- Isolated routing table, kind of like a container 
- Easiest to think of each VRF like a virtual routing table in a container 
- Interfaces are assigned to a VRF 
- Everything not in a VRF is in “the global ” default VRF (global table) 
- In MPLS -VPN each customer has a VRF 
- VRFs for customers, default global vrffor the Provider 24 PE1 PE2SP Network Customer A Customer B Customer A Customer B Customer C Global Network BRKMPL -2103
© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveMP-BGP (Multi Protocol BGP) 
- MP-BGP extends BGP to carry more than just IPv4 prefixes 
- Introduced “ address family ” style configuration 
- Allows for IPv6, MPLS and other info in same BGP session between neighbors 
- When session is established the capabilities are negotiated 
- No new rules, still requires full mesh or Route -Reflectors 
- RRs need to support additional capabilities 
- L3VPN Relies on Extended Communities attributes 
- Extended Communities are arbitrary TLVs attached to BGP prefixes 
- Most common for vrfimport/export filtering is route -target extended community. 25 BRKMPL -2103
© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveMP-BGP: Address -Families 
- Address -family “vpnv4 ”, “ipv4 unicast vrf” introduced 
- vpnv4 AFI for PE to PE (label information) 
- ipv4 unicast vrffor PE to CE 
- Neighbor must be “activated” for each AFI supported 
- Equally applies to vpnv6 and ipv6 26 BRKMPL -2103
© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveRTs and RDs: Creating the VRF 
- VRFs have 3 parts: 1. VRF name: case sensitive, local scope only 2. Route Distinguisher (RD): global scope 3. Route Target(s) (RT) 
- RD and RT are for VPNv4; RD must always be defined 
- RD must be unique to the VRFs on the local PE 
- If there is no MPLS, called “VRF -lite” 27 BRKMPL -2103
© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveUnderstanding the RD 
- Route Distinguisher Every CE route from all VRFs are placed in a single VPNv4 table How are routes from one VRF distinguished from another VRF? => By prepending the RD to the route to create a unique global VPNv4 route Only used to make routes unique VPNv4 prefixes, thus VRF CE routes can overlap. VRF IPv4 Route: 192.168.1.0/24 RD: 100:100 VPNv4 Route NLRI: 
- NLRI Length: 112 bits (= 14 bytes) 
- Label MPLS (3 bytes) 
- RD:100:100 (8 bytes) 
- IPv4 network: 192.168.10/24 (3 bytes) 28 BRKMPL -2103
© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveUnderstanding the Route -Target Route Target 
- RT is a BGP extended community (attribute attached the NLRI) 
- “route -target export ” adds the community to the outbound update 
- from local VRF to VPNV4 
- “route -target import ” defines which routes to bring into the VRF 
- from VPNv4 to local VRF 
- Multiple imports and exports RT allowed 
- Allows to leak routes from one/many VRF to one/many other VRFs 29 BRKMPL -2103

- BGP maintains a table for each AFI (vpnv4, ipv4, vrf…) 
- CE routes are placed into the vpnv4 BGP table 
- BGP routes in a vrfAFI are automatically turned into vpnv4 routes 
- If BGP is not PE -CE protocol routes must be redistributed into ipv4 vrf AFI 
- All vpnv4 routes get an assigned service vpnlabel for mpls forwarding 
- When inserted into vpnv4 from vrf 
- When propagated to other BGP neighbors if nexthop is changed 
- vpnv4 routes are exchanged between vpnv4 peers (PEs) 31 BRKMPL -2103
© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveVPN Labeling 
- VPN Labeling uses two labels: Transport Label and VPN Label 
- Transport label gets packet from local PE to remote PE 
- VPN label identifies the VRF to the remote PE 
- P Routers are unaware of VPN label 
- Within the MPLS cloud forwarding is just PE to PE 
- Forwarding happens in two parts: 1.Get the packet through the MPLS cloud to the remote PE (loopback) 2.Put the packet in the correct VRF for a routing lookup via the VPN label 32 BRKMPL -2103

BGP Deployment scenarios L3VPN
© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveInter-AS Option A 
- Option A is the simplest of the interconnection options. 
- The AS Border Router (ASBR) of each AS defines an interface or sub -interface per VRF. Once defined, the ASBR will instantiate the VRF assigning the sub -interface to the VPN. This needs to be done per VPN requiring Inter -AS service. 
- The sub -interfaces facing the other AS doesn’t transport labeled traffic, only regular IP traffic. In order to exchange routing information with the remote ASBR, any routing protocol can be used. 
- From the ASBR1 point of view, the remote AS is seen like any other regular CE device. 36 BRKMPL -2103 ASBR1 ASBR2 CE6 PE2 PE1 CE1 CE2 CE3 PE3 CE4 CE5 AS 65001 AS 650021 Sub interface per VRFMP-BGP VPNv4 MP-BGP VPNv4MP-BGP VPNv4 OSPF + LDPIS-IS + SR BGP/OSPF/…. IP IP MPLS SR-MPLSIP (Unlabeled) CE

© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveInter-AS Option B 
- The Option B is the second option covered in RFC 4364 for interconnecting sites of VPN customers connected to different autonomous systems 
- Inter-AS Option B tries to avoid the operational complexity needed to set up a new VPN customer with inter -as connectivity by moving complexity. The new procedure partially solve scalability problems but introduces some new ones we didn’t have with Option A. 
- There is no need to configure one VRF per -VPN customer demanding interconnection. The ASBRs should be directly connected and perform the route exchange using a single interface (physical or logical) not assigned to a VRF. 38 BRKMPL -2103 ASBR1 ASBR2 CE6 PE2 PE1 CE1 CE2 CE3 PE3 CE4 CE5 AS 65001 AS 650021 interface not in VRFMP-BGP VPNv4 MP-BGP VPNv4MP-BGP VPNv4 OSPF + LDPIS-IS + SR IP IP MPLS SR-MPLSCE MP-BGP VPNv4 MPLS

© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveInter-AS Option C 
- Inter-AS Option C is the third option for interconnecting multi -AS backbones covered in RFC 4364. It’s the most scalable option of the three so far and it has its own applicability scenarios that we must be aware of to apply this design properly. 
- the ASBRs don’t carry any of the VPN routes. ASBRs only take care of distributing labeled IPv4 routes of the PEs within their own AS. 
- To improve scalability, one MP -EBGP VPNv4 session transports all VPN routes (external routes) between PEs or RR. In the case of using RR to exchange the external routes, the next hop of the VPNv4 routes must be preserved. 
- The ASBR use EBGP to exchange the internal PE routing information between AS (internal routes). These internal routes correspond to the BGP next -hops of the external routes advertised through the multi -hop MP -EBGP session between PEs or RRs. The internal routes advertised by the ASBRs can be used to establish the MP -EBGP sessions between PEs and allows for LSP setup from the ingress to the egress PE. 40 BRKMPL -2103 ASBR1 ASBR2 CE6 PE2 PE1 CE1 CE2 CE3 PE3 CE4 CE5 AS 65001 AS 650021 interface not in VRF OSPF + LDPIS-IS + SR IP IPCE BGP IPv4 + label RR1 RR2 VPNv4VPNv4 MPLSMultihop EBGP VPNv4 NextHop Preservation

- not always a good option QoS enforcement per VPN isn’t possible at ASBR 
- VPN context doesn’t exist at ASBRs 
- Not possible to perform policing, filtering or accounting with per VPN granularity at ASBR Which make this solution not a very good option when Autonomous Systems don’t have a strong trust relationship between them BRKMPL -2103
Scaling BGP networks 
© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveRoute Reflector 
- By default, full mesh of BGP peering is needed across all iBGP peers 
- if a new BGP speaker is in the network, config change is needed all over network 
- As the number of peers grows, the total number of sessions also grows like square 
- A route reflector is a BGP speaker that will reflect routes learned from other iBGP peers. 
- If RR is not in the forwarding plane, BGP table policy can be used to prevent route getting downloaded to RIB 
- All routers from a peering relationship only with the Route Reflector. 
- New addition in network does not require config change at any other BGP peer Any challenge with just having RR ? BRKMPL -2103 43

© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveBGP Additional path (ADD Path) 
- BGP routers and route reflectors (RRs) propagate only their best path over their sessions. 
- The BGP Additional Paths feature is implemented by adding a 32 bits path identifier to each path in the NLRI. 
- The path identifier ID can be considered something similar to a route distinguisher (RD) in VPNs, except that a path ID can apply to any address family. 
- Path IDs are unique to a peering session and are generated for each network. 
- Since path ID is part of the NLRI key, it is used to prevent a route announcement from implicitly replace/withdraw the previous one. 
- Increase path diversity for the RR clients, thus able to perform better/faster path selection 
- Higher path scale 47 BRKMPL -2103

- eBGP sessions exist between the PE and CE routers. 
- Traffic from CE1 uses PE1 to reach network 192.168.2.0/24 through router CE2. 
- CE1 has two paths: 
- PE1 as the primary path. 
- PE2 as the backup/alternate path. 
- CE1 is configured with the BGP PIC feature. BGP computes PE1 as the best path and PE2 as the backup/alternate path and installs both routes into the RIB. 
- In case of CE1 -PE1 link failure, traffic immediately takes alternate path in CEF (until BGP reconverge)192.168.1.0/24 TrafficRoutes 
© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveBGP Multipath load balancing 
- A BGP routing process will install a single path as the best path in the routing information base (RIB) by default. 
- The BGP multipath allows you to configure BGP to install multiple paths in the RIB for multipath load sharing. 
- Load balancing over the multipaths is performed by CEF. 
- CEF load balancing is done on per flow basis. 
- The BGP Multipath Load Sharing for both eBGP and iBGP in an MPLS VPN allows multihomed AS and PE routers to be configured to distribute traffic across both eBGP and iBGP paths. 
- By default, Equal Cost Multi Path (ECMP) 
- Unequal Cost Multi Path (UCMP) weighed on nexthop igpmetric also possible 49 BRKMPL -2103
© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveRT Constrained, why we need it ? 
- Some deployments have a large number of routing updates sent from RR to PE which can require extensive use of resource 
- A PE does not need routing updates for VRFs that are not locally configured; therefore, the PE determines that many routing updates it receives are "unwanted." The PE filters out the unwanted updates. 50 BRKMPL -2103 VRF-Green VRF-GreenVRF-Purple VRF-Purple VRF-BlueVRF-Blue VRF-Red VRF-Red Unwanted VRF route for PE Unwanted VRF route for RR PE1 PE2RR1 RR2PE3 PE4

- To filter out the unwanted routes described in the "Problem that BGP RT Constrained Route Distribution the PEs and RRs must be configured with the BGP: RT Constrained Route Distribution feature (ipv4 rt -filter AF) 
- The feature allows the PE to propagate RT membership and use the RT membership to limit the VPN routing information maintained at the PE and RR. The PE uses an MP-BGP UPDATE message to propagate the membership information. The RR restricts the advertisement of VPN routes based on the RT membership information it received 
- This feature causes two exchanges to happen: 
- The PE sends RT Constraint (RTC) Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) to the RR. 
- The RR installs an outbound route filter 51 BRKMPL -2103 PE1 RR PE2VRF-Blue RT1 VRF-Red RT2VRF-Red RT2 VRF-Green RT3RT-Constraint: NLRI = { RT1, RT2}RT-Constraint: NLRI = { RT2, RT3}
BGP security
© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveBGP: is Security important? 
- BGP serves as the backbone of internet traffic. 
- Even though it is the most important component of the internet core, it needs the capability to verify if the ingress BGP announcement originated from an authorized autonomous system or not. 
- BGP makes it an easy candidate for various kinds of attacks. One common attack is called ‘route hijack’. This attack can be exploited to: 
- Steal IPs to send spam results in IP getting rejected and hence denial of service. 
- Spy on traffic to obtain sensitive information like passwords. BRKMPL -2103 53

Best Practices 
© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Public #CiscoLiveBest Practices 
- Use RR to scale BGP; deploy RRs in pair for the redundancy Keep RRs out of the forwarding paths and do not install BGP route in RIB 
- Choose AS format for RT and RD i.e., ASN: X Reserve first few 100s of X for the internal purposes such as filtering 
- Consider unique RD per VRF per PE (vs same RD per VRF across all PEs) Helpful for many scenarios such as multi -homing, hub & spoke. Helpful to avoid add -path since unique RD brings uniqueness => all propagated by RR. Unique RD allow VRF import policy to modify attributes since path copied from remote RD to local RD. By opposition, same RD does not allow path attributes modification. 
- Utilize SP’s public address space for PE -CE IP addressing Helps to avoid overlapping; Use /31 subnetting on PE -CE interfaces BRKMPL -2103 57

- TCP authentication (MD5/TCP -AO) per bgpsession 
- Limit number of prefixes per-VRF and/or per -neighbor on PE Max-prefix within VRF configuration; Suppress the inactive routes Max-prefix for EBGP neighbor with discard/reset, threshold warning only for IBGP 
- Leverage BGP Prefix Independent Convergence (PIC) for fast convergence <100ms 
- PIC Core: backup path with NO change in BGP nexthop. - PIC Edge: backup path with change in BGP nexthop. - Best-external advertisement 
- Next-hop tracking (ON by default) 
- Consider RT -constraint for PE & RR scalability (millions of routes) 
- Consider ‘BGP slow peer’ for PE or RR –faster BGP convergence 
- Use a dedicated VPN for CE Management 
- Do not configure nexthop trigger delay 0, use PIC 58 BRKMPL -2103
