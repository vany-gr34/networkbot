Connect additional devices to the router Wired: Connect one end of an Ethernet cable to any YELLOW Ethernet port on the router and then connect the other end to the Ethernet port on your device. Wireless: You will find the wireless network names and password details on the sticker on the BOTTOM of your router. Go to your device’s Wi-Fi settings and select a Wi-Fi network name that matches your router from the list of available wireless networks. Enter the Wi-Fi password to securely connect your device to your router. Personalize your router Open a web browser and type in “http://192.168.254.254”. This will launch the main status page for the router that also allows you to personalize your settings, such as your Wi-Fi name or password. Note: You will be asked to enter the Device Access Code (located on the bottom of the router) if you make changes to these settings. Please also note any changes you’ve made to the router in the event you need support. Home wiring connections Frontier® uses an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) and a router to connect your home to the internet and enable Data, Voice and TV Services. If the steps above do not result in an internet connection, you may be guided to check the cables on the ONT. Ethernet-connected homes will require BOTH Ethernet and Coax connections from the ONT to the router for TV service. 1 Confirm the Coax connector on the ONT is securely connected to the home wiring used by the router (or directly to the router). Many ONTs require this connection for both Data and TV services. 2 Confirm the Ethernet connector on the ONT is securely connected to the home wiring used by the router (or directly to the router). Many ONTs require this connection for Data services. To determine if the ONT is provisioned for Ethernet or MoCA, look for the light on the ONT: - DATA light ON: Ethernet is provisioned. - MoCA or HPNA light ON: Coax is provisioned.
