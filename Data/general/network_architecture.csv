"netbrain this week is launching version 12.1 of its eponymousnetwork automationplatform. this latest release represents a significant evolution in the companys approach to network management, with a strong emphasis on ai capabilities that aim to transform how enterprises handle complex network environments. netbrain today is an automation and ai platform for network visibility, lingping gao, founder and ceo of netbrain technology, toldnetwork world. the problem we try to solve is how to automate network mapping first as adigital twin, then how to automate the troubleshooting to solve problems without human involvement, and then drive that further to things like assessment and changes. the 12.1 release represents the culmination of this vision introducing a series of advanced features. key highlights of netbrain nextgen 12.1 the core innovation in netbrain 12.1 lies in how it positions ai within network management workflows. where previous versions used ai as a tool or copilot, 12.1 elevates ai to function as an expert problem solver. this release is all about the next level of ai, which is ai as a problem solver, ai as an expert,gaoexplained. when a problem is submitted to netbrain, the system executes itsautomation tools, orchestrating them through ai to diagnose issues, recommend fixes and even close tickets automatically. as an example,gaosaid that if an organization sends a trouble ticket from servicenow into the netbrains ai agent, without any human involvement, the problem can be triaged and remediated. the system can provide a summary of the actions that were executed and then close the trouble ticket. at the foundation of netbrains platform is its multitiered digital twin technology, which creates a model of network infrastructure. unlike basic network mapping tools that focus primarily on device discovery, netbrain builds a fourlayered model gaoemphasized that in his view, the key to managing a modern network is to understand intent. the 12.1 release enhances this capability with the automatic discovery of network intent. the goal is to create a distributed, intelligent network modeling system that can discover and manage network intent without heavy human intervention, using ai and automation to continuously assess and adapt network configurations. as part of the 12.1 update, the new postmortem analysis feature allows organizations to quickly investigate network issues across their entire infrastructure. the system will automatically scan an entire network for similar problems after an outage. by using intentbased network mapping, ai and automation, netbrain will then take the initial postmortem findings and use that information for ongoing monitoring, tracking similar potential failure points across the network and proactively identifying potential future incidents. looking ahead, netbrain is working on creating more aipowered network automation capabilities to reduce the need for handson human interventions. this vision represents a significant shift in network management, with ai increasingly handling complex operational tasks that previously required human expertise, allowing network professionals to focus on more strategic initiatives. more and more human tasks are shifting to automation, with more automation shifting to ai,gaosaid. i can see 50 of network operations tasks now can be ai enabled in a matter of months right now. sean michael kerner is an it consultant, technology enthusiast and tinkerer, and has been known to spend his spare time immersed in the study of the klingon language and satellite pictures of area 51. he has pulled token ring, configured netware and has been known to compile his own linux kernel. he consults to industry and media organizations on technology issues. sponsored links",https://www.networkworld.com/article/3959191/netbrain-boosts-ai-smarts-to-automatically-diagnose-remediate-network-problems.html

"there was mixed reaction from industry analysts monday over an announcement fromnvidiathat it plans to produceai supercomputersentirely in the us for the first time. the company said in ablog postthat, together with its manufacturing partners, it has commissioned more than one million square feet 92,900 square meters of manufacturing space to build and test nvidia blackwell chips in arizona, and ai supercomputers in texas. the post went on to say that nvidia plans to produce up to half a trillion dollars ofai infrastructurein the us through partnerships with tsmc, foxconn, wistron, amkor, and spil. it added, nvidia ai supercomputers are the engines of a new type of data center created for the sole purpose of processing artificial intelligence ai factories that are the infrastructure powering a new ai industry. manufacturing nvidia ai chips and supercomputers for american ai factories will create hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive trillions of dollars in economic security over the coming decades. in reaction,scott bickley, advisory fellow atinfotech research group, said, the reality of this announcement, based on the suppliers mentioned, specifically foxconn, wistron, amkor, and spil, speaks to the migration of the chip testing, packaging, and noderack assembly to the us to take the tariff issue off the table. the reference to chip manufacturing via tsmc is not new news, as those investment announcements have already been made weeks ago. as for the job creation prediction, he said he is skeptical that this announcement will lead to hundreds of thousands of new jobs, as nvidia claims, since employing robotics and manufacturing automation is a stated goal. this is, said bickley, a job killer, not a job enabler. the reality is that this announcement likely seeks to appease the us governments desire to reshore this work in the us. however, the majority of the final server assembly work already takes place in mexico today, at a much lower cost of labor than can be realized in the us. he said, likely a hedge to delay tariff impacts on nvidia products coupled with a strategy to start the process of building highly automated facilities that can close the labor arbitrage gap that exists today. patrick moorhead, founder and chief analyst atmoor insights strategy, said he was waiting for something out of nvidia, as the company has been quiet on things related to tariffs. the companys plans, he said, likely revolve aroundl11 production, which is the creation of a fully tested system. i doubt this includes pca mainboard manufacturing or they would have said this discretely. therefore, it is still likely that the mainboards will be produced in taiwan or mexico. the highestperformanceai serversare a challenge to build, test, and validate. therefore, said moorhead, it makes sense that nvidia would do this in the us for us customers. i believe some oems like dell technologies already do l11 in the us. the wildcard here is the import duties on the different components coming in from taiwan, china, and mexico. in the announcement, jensen huang, founder and ceo of nvidia, said, the engines of the worlds ai infrastructure are being built in the united states for the first time. adding american manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for ai chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain and boosts our resiliency. the company stated that it will utilize its advanced ai, robotics, anddigital twin technologiesto design and operate the facilities, including employing nvidia omniverse to create digital twins of factories and nvidia isaac gr00t to build robots to automate manufacturing. nvidia blackwell chips have started production at tsmcs chip plants in phoenix, arizona, it said. nvidia is building supercomputer manufacturing plants in texas, with foxconn in houston, and with wistron in dallas. mass production at both plants is expected to ramp up in the next 1215 months. forrester senior analystalvin nguyensaid monday in an email that nvidias plan makes sense in light of the fluid tariff situation. leveraging partners such as foxconn, wistron, tsmc, amcor, and spil will help accelerate the development of a us ai server supply chain. this helps them preserve access to ai chips and infrastructure to companies with us locations without a cost penaltydisadvantage that could help erode their ai leadership position and slow down ai adoption in the us. further, the plan echoes his separate commentary last week about the tariffs, in which he predicted, when it comes to semiconductors, there will bemore foundries being built around the world as the push for geographic diversity and the supporting supply chains are deployed. this will be beneficial as there is less dependence on taiwan for the majority of chip production. he added, this may cause some changes to data center investments depending on the state of tariffs and the cost impacts by location. enterprises may be incentivized to time buildouts to where they see better returns, but this is where sovereignty laws ai and data will also have an impact and can completely change the basis for where to build data centers. paul barker is a freelance journalist whose work has appeared in a number of technology magazines and online with the subject matter ranging from

"arm holdings expects its architecture will account for half of the data center cpu market share by the end of this year, and to help achieve those goals it has launched a batch of new migration tools for application porting. mohamed awad, senior vice president and general manager of the infrastructure business at arm made the claim in ablog posting, citing arms lower power consumption than x86 processors. as a result, armbased products have become increasingly popular even with the big cloud computing companies, which are concerned about the power drain of their massive bit barns, awad said. there has been considerable activity around arm in recent years. amazon web services, microsoft, and google have all design their own custom silicon for their respective cloud services. nvidia has entered the cpu business with its own arm processor, codenamed grace. qualcomm is reportedly looking to enter the market after several aborted attempts. japanese giant softbank acquired arm and attempted to sell it to nvidia in 2021 but the deal collapsed facing considerable opposition. and just last monthsoftbank acquired ampere, the maker of armbased server chips primarily used by oracle. thats just on the processing side. arm cores are also used in a number of smartnics for intelligent network routing. so to that end, arm has introduced a series of new developer tools and services designed to support rapid migration of x86 apps to the arm architecture. our goal is to ensure developers have comprehensive support and access to indepth resources for a seamless migration to arm, enabling them to fully maximize the benefits of arm in the cloud, wrote bhumik patel, director of server ecosystem development at arm in his ownblog post. through its learning paths tutorials along with workloadspecific technical walkthroughs, developers can receive assistance across the various stages of a migration project and can directly engage with arm cloud migration experts for project support. the cloud migration resource hub provides resources on migrating the most common workloads with over 100 stepbystep learning paths for migrating major workloads across multiple cloud platforms. in addition, the software ecosystem dashboard for arm provides uptodate information on compatible arm versions of major open source and commercial software components. in the cloud, developers moving ai workloads can use arm kleidi integrations in the latest generation of leading frameworks like opensource machine learning framework, pytorch and benefit from dramatic ai performance improvements on arm without taking any extra steps., experts say. these updates will have an immediate impact in assisting cloud developers in making their move to arm, but its not the only investment were making to ensure arm is the most developerfriendly platform, patel wrote. andy patrizio is a freelance journalist based in southern california who has covered the computer industry for 20 years and has built every x86 pc hes ever owned, laptops not included.the opinions expressed in this blog are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of itworld, network world, its parent, subsidiary or affiliated companies. andy patrizio is a freelance journalist based in southern california who has covered the computer industry for 20 years and has built every x86 pc hes ever owned, laptops not included. the opinions expressed in this blog are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of itworld, network world, its parent, subsidiary or affiliated companies. sponsored links",https://www.networkworld.com/article/3959748/arm-backs-big-data-center-ambitions-with-migration-tools.html
"cisco recently celebrated its 40 anniversary, and its mission to connect the world remains intact. its focused on critical areas such as ai and cybersecurity that have worldwide relevance, including in spain, where cisco has more than three decades of history, says andreu vilamitjana, general manager of cisco in iberia, who spoke recently at the companys engage event in madrid. one of the milestones highlighted by vilamitjana came in november 2022, when cisco announced plans to build a nextgeneration semiconductor design center in barcelona leveraging the eu chips act, a european union plan to strengthen europes competitiveness and capacity in the chip industry. this is one of the examples, in vilamitjanas words, of the companys involvement and vision in the country to achieve a more inclusive, fair and happy society. in addition, cisco has trained some 350,000 people in digital skills through programs such as digitaliza and cisco networking academy. vilamitjana also highlighted ciscos commitment to sustainability, its focus on clean energy, and its emphasis on artificial intelligence and the ethics of ai. in this regard, cisco has a dedicated 1 billion fund to boost startups. one of the pillars of ciscos current strategy is based on ai and the preparation of data centers that enable ai and that need, according to an internal study, more maturity for the future. although 47 of local organizations already allocate between 10 and 30 of their it budget to ai mainly in cybersecurity, data management and analytics only 9 have an infrastructure that is fully prepared to take advantage of ais potential. vilamitjana referred two additional areas of focus for the company. one is the creation of the workplace for the future, with new collaborative models and a multitude of connected devices, which is especially relevant in spain after the covid crisis that began in 2020. the second focus is cybersecurity, an area that cisco has been refining in recent years with major acquisitions such as splunk. this story originally appeared oncomputerworld spain. mario moreno es coordinador editorial en espaa decomputerworldy de su cabecera especializada en ciberseguridadcso y redactor decio sponsored links",https://www.networkworld.com/article/3959896/cisco-underscores-its-absolute-focus-on-areas-critical-to-spains-technological-development.html
"googles big bet on nuclear energy the race to power aidriven data centers is accelerating your email has been sent google has unveiled plans to lead the way in the adoption of nuclear energy for the data center. at data center world 2025 in washington d.c., the company explained some of the details of its partnership with kairos power to develop up to 500 mw of nuclear energy through small modular reactors smrs. backed by a 300 million grant from the us department of energys advanced reactor demonstration program, this initiative aims for initial deployment by 2030, with further expansion of the site through 2035. the race to power aidriven data centers is accelerating, and securing sustainable, reliable energy at scale is more critical than ever, said lucia tian, head of clean energy decarbonization at google. this project is one facet of googles goal to be carbon free on a 24 x 7 x 365 basis by matching our electricity demand with clean sources. for the last many years, the company has been a major purchaser of wind and solar energy resources, but the power requirements of the latest generative ai applications have changed the game. google needs more power than ever and is developing a broad portfolio of clean energy assets this now includes nuclear energy as well as geothermal power. this strategy is far more cost effective and dependable as we need to operate on more than variable wind and solar, said tian. anyone wanting to build a brand new largescale nuclear plant can expect to wait as long as a decade before they experience the benefits in terms of available energy production. smrs are seen as a way to reduce the delay. the first units are expected to enter operation by the end of the decade. tian touched upon the abrupt aboutface in public perception concerning nuclear energy. over the last two years, everything has changed, she said. until 2022, nuclear plants were either being shuttered or scheduled for decommissioning now, decommissioned facilities like palisades in michigan and three mile island in pennsylvania are being recommissioned. in addition, some of these recommissioned facilities will also host new smrs. support for new nuclear energy has surged in the us in the last couple of years, said tian. those communities where there is active nuclear energy generation are incredibly supportive. however, some countries are less accepting of nuclear energy, and we have to be sensitive to local needs. seegoogle, amazon, meta back goal of massively increasingly global nuclear capacity by 2050 tian stressed the importance of partnering in the development of nuclear energy resources. google is an expert at cloud, search, ai, and many other facets of it but not energy generation hence, the companys partnership with kairos power in the development of smrs. jeff olson, vice president of business development finance at kairos power, said google is catalyzing the revival of nuclear energy and smrs in the us. his company is developing and commercializing a 150 mw reactor modules of this size can be grouped together to create larger blocks of generation. initial smr designs of a scaleddown version have been undergoing extensive testing. once finished, a fullsize unit will be built and validated before kairos goes into the commercialization phase. we thought utilities would be our first customers, but google came along with a strong desire to accelerate development, said olson. kairos power thought 150 mw would be more than enough for the data center market, but customers like google are now talking about 1 gw data centers. this need can be met, he said, by combining a series of 150 mw smr units at one site. the more units you deploy, the greater the economies of scale, said olson. the data center industry is inspiring nuclear innovation, and ai is creating the demand. learn how to get the most out of google docs, google cloud platform, google apps, chrome os, and all the other google products used in business environments. delivered fridays learn how to get the most out of google docs, google cloud platform, google apps, chrome os, and all the other google products used in business environments. delivered fridays googles big bet on nuclear energy the race to power aidriven data centers is accelerating your email has been sent get the webs best business technology news, tutorials, reviews, trends, and analysisin your inbox. lets start with the basics. indicates required fields lost your password?request a new password please enter your email adress. you will receive an email message with instructions on how to reset your password. check your email for a password reset link. if you didnt receive an email dont forgot to check your spam folder, otherwisecontact support. this will help us provide you with customized content. thanks for signing up!

"trumps tariffs will they affect your tech prices? your email has been sent us president donald trump temporarily reduced tariffs on most countries to 10, but raised chinese tariffs to a whopping 145. as of april 18, the u.s. administration plans to meet with china regarding trade deals. hours after higher countryspecific tariffs took effect on april 9, trump announced that most countries would be receiving a 90day pause to allow time for trade negotiations. instead, they will be subject to a 10 levy while their representatives attempt to hammer out a deal with the us. china was the notable exception to this pause, with trump announcing that the country would be subject to an additional 125 tariff on all goods, effective immediately. on april 10, the white house clarified that this tariff is additive, meaning that it will be levied on top of the 20 tariff that was already in place. this brings the total tariff rates on chinese goods to a staggering 145. trump said that he was issuing this massive additional tariff on china because of a lack of respect that china has shown to the worlds markets. china is the uss third largest trading partner, after canada and mexico. tech devices remain the uss top import from china, so this 145 tariff will likely cause prices to rise significantly. this tariff will apply to common tech products such as smartphones, computers, monitors, game consoles, and lithiumion batteries, as well as less obvious items such as small kitchen appliances and air purifiers. despite the 10 tariff rate for most countries, no changes were made to the 25 tariffs levied on canada and mexico, which were originally instituted in february. goods compliant with the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca, including auto parts from canada and mexico, continue to remain exempt. trump says that trade deficits where the us spends more on imports from these nations than it earns through exports are the result of higher foreign tariffs, nontariff barriers, and economic policies abroad that depress wages and limit domestic consumption. tariffs have also been applied to countries with low tariff rates but high trade surpluses with the us, like the uk and australia. the president managed to pass them without congressional approval, declaring a national emergency and claiming that persistent trade imbalances undermine national security by weakening us manufacturing and exposing supply chains to foreign dependence. seetrumps import tariffs how theyll shake prices, jobs, and trade separately, trump revoked the de minimis tariff exemptions onchinese and hong kong imports valued at 800or less. he announced the change on april 2, and it will take effect on may 2. this reversal will impact popular ecommerce companies, such as shein and temu, that ship directly to international consumers from warehouses in china and hong kong. beginning may 2, consumers will have to pay 30 import fees, with a minimum of a 25 fee per package this minimum will eventually rise to 50 per package. trump also intends to extend this policy to other countries with comparable exemptions. while these tariffs were brought to restore economic fairness, boost manufacturing, and create more jobs in the us, they are also expected to trigger price increases in tech products. according tocnbc, after trumps initial announcement on april 1, nvidias stock fell by 5, while apple and amazon fell by 6. this is due to fears that their operational costs will rise and supply chains, which rely heavily on overseas manufacturing and imports, will be disrupted. us chipmaker nvidia should be somewhat shielded from the impact due totrumps exemption on semiconductors, sparing it from the 32 tariff on chips manufactured in taiwan by tsmc. however, it remains unclear whether the semiconductor exemption will also cover the 10 baseline tariff on all imports. furthermore, the trump administration said on april 15 that exceptions for smartphones, computers and semiconductors from chinamay be temporary. apple products, mostly manufactured in china, india, and vietnam, are likely to become more expensive as the company passes increased import costs onto us consumers. the prices of iphones could rise to3,500if produced domestically. amazon might do the same, as a high proportion of the goods listed on its marketplace are from chinese sellers. the ecommerce giant will especially be impacted by the removal of the tax exemption on products under 800. theus relies on china and taiwanfor approximately 80 of its foundry capacity for 20 to 45nm chips and about 70 for 50 to 180nm chips. tech firms may attempt to shift sourcing to reciprocal tarifffree countries, but many will pass the additional costs to consumers instead. overall, the administrations dealmaking in regards to tariffs, essentially holding trade as a bargaining chip, has caused uncertainty and a dip in the stock market. on april 18, trumpsaidhis administration is in talks with china about a new tariff deal that could come clear in the next three or four weeks. these new tariffs come after those imposed in february 25 on all imports from canada and mexicoexcept energy resources and minerals,20 on chinese goods, and 25 on european union tech components like semiconductors. with 80 of us foundry capacity for key semiconductor sizes currently reliant on china and taiwan, experts predicted ripple effects across the entire tech sector, impacting everything from smartphones and cloud services to ai infrastructure. at the time, gil luria, head of technology research at d.a. davidson, toldbloombergthat part of the reason trump is implementing tariffs on goods from the e.u. is in retaliation for the region making a habit of fining major us companies, such asapple,google, andmeta, for whatever behavior they choose to penalize. he added that the e.u. may become combative in response, and the level to which it does will determine the scale of the tariffs impact on the big tech players. seewere the white houses tariffs calculations done by ai? the expanded tariffs onaluminiumandsteelfrom february are predicted to hit data center companies, as these materials are essential for server racks, cooling systems, and other infrastructure, driving up construction and equipment costs. the additional expenditure and potential supply chain disruption may be reflected in increased cloud storage prices from companies like aws, google cloud, and microsoft azure, as well as saas and ai companies that utilise largescale data processing. it could also delay plans to build new data centers that companies have earmarked to meet the growing demand for ai. nevertheless, the stated intention is to reduce dependence on foreign adversaries. while this may result in higher prices for consumers in the short term, it could also drive investment in domestic industries and boost supply chain resilience. seemicrosoft to invest 80 billion in ai data centers in fiscal 2025 even prior to the tariffs, many companies have been announcing plans to build new facilities within the us, which is a trend likely to continue. in march,tsmc pledged to expand its spendon building data centers in the us to 160 billion, which it deems the largest single foreign direct investment in u.s. history. in february,apple announced it will spend 500 billionon manufacturing and research in the us over the next four years. in january, thestargate projectwas launched, which saw companies including softbank, openai, and oracle dedicate 500 billion togenerative aiinfrastructure in the us, including data centers. in the press conference for the tsmc investment, trump added that there are still many more companies that want to announce construction projects stateside. such companies could absorb the business of foreign competitors in the chip, cloud, and other hardware markets. technologyadvice freelance contributing writer kara
