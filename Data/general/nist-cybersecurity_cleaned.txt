White Paper Cisco PublicLet Cisco Secure help In the next few pages, we’ll show how Cisco’s effective security aligns with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. We’ll list each Framework function and category, and explain exactly how Cisco Secure products and services help you accomplish each specific Framework goal. Our solutions are simple, open, and automated to interoperate at every level of the security stack, not only across the Cisco portfolio but also with other vendors’ products. Furthermore, our solutions build industry-leading, actionable Talos threat intelligence directly into them. With Cisco Secure, you can take a new approach to cybersecurity, adopt the Framework, and bolster cyber defenses and readiness.Cybersecurity can seem overwhelming, and there’s plenty of long to-do lists. The Center for Internet Security (CIS) has the Critical Security Controls, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has its 27000-series publications, and ISACA manages its COBIT 5 framework. Layer those atop compliance mandates like the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) — and it’s often hard to know where to start. That’s why the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed the Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). It enables organizations of all sizes to discuss, address, and manage cybersecurity risk. And without reinventing the cyber wheel, it references existing best practices through its Core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. The CSF Profiles and Tiers work with the Core to drive a simple yet effective cybersecurity risk management process that can plug into existing governance and risk management processes. However, even with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, many organizations still need more help. Critical tasks like risk assessment, gap analysis, and action planning are left to you. Then there’s a dizzying array of security products on the market today from which to select. Often they have overlapping or missing capabilities and, worse, don’t integrate with one another. There are simply not enough skilled cybersecurity professionals available to configure and manage all of those tools, let alone analyze and act on their output. Where can you get the solutions and guidance you really need for a truly effective cybersecurity program?From the largest federal agency to the smallest school district, every organization today is faced with managing cybersecurity risks efficiently and effectively. Can yours benefit from an innovative, best practices approach to cybersecurity? © 2022 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Secure and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework | 3

White Paper Cisco PublicCisco Secure Supports the NIST Cybersecurity Framework Cisco Secure’s comprehensive cybersecurity product and services portfolio defends organizations throughout the world against today’s advanced threats. Figure 2 shows how our cybersecurity products map to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework: Figure 2: Cisco Secure Product Aligns with the Framework Cisco Secure Endpoint and Cisco Secure Malware Analytics Cisco Umbrella SIG Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Cisco Meraki SMCisco Kenna Cisco Secure ClientCisco Secure Workload Cisco Secure Email and Cisco Secure Web Gateway Cisco ISE Cisco SecureXCisco Secure Network Analytics Cisco Umbrella and Cisco Umbrella Investigate Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Cisco Cyber VisionCloudlock Cisco Secure IPS Cisco Secure Access by Duo Cisco Secure Services IDAsset Management Business Environment Non-technical control area Governance Non-technical control area Risk Assessment Risk Management Supply Chain Cisco Security and Trust Organization (S&TO) PRAccess Control Awareness Training Data Security Info Protection Process Non-technical control area Maintenance Protective Technology DEAnomalies and Events Continuous Monitoring Detection Process Non-technical control area RSResponse Planning Non-technical control area Communications Non-technical control area Analysis Mitigation Improvements Non-technical control area RCRecovery Planning Non-technical control area Improvements Non-technical control area Communications Non-technical control area The green boxes show where Cisco Secure products supports the Framework’s desired outcomes. For example, Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) profiles and categorizes devices when they attempt to connect to the network. Knowing what’s on the network is a key step toward effective Asset Management (Identify function). And Cisco Secure Network Analytics baselines network traffic patterns and detect suspicious activity, critical capabilities for the Anomalies and Events category (Detect function). © 2022 Cisco and/or its affiliates.

White Paper Cisco PublicCybersecurity products alone cannot cover the entire Framework. For example, the Awareness and Training category (Protect function) ensures that people are provided with cybersecurity awareness education and are adequately trained to perform their duties. The Detection Processes category (Detect function) ensures that people understand their roles; that detection processes are tested and improved; and event detection information is communicated and reported properly. Therefore, Figure 2 shows the non-technical control areas; that is, those categories where people and process related controls (and not technical controls) are required. Cisco Secure Services can help with all areas of the Framework, including the nontechnical controls. We can help your organization adopt the Framework and use it to effectively manage cybersecurity risk. Figure 3 shows how our Advisory, Integration and Managed services can help you adopt the NIST Cybersecurity Framework: Figure 3: Cisco Secure Services: NIST CSF Alignment Advisory Integration Managed IDAsset Management ✓ ✓ ✓ Business Environment ✓ Governance ✓ Risk Assessment ✓ ✓ ✓ Risk Management ✓ ✓ Supply Chain ✓ PRAccess Control ✓ ✓ ✓ Awareness Training ✓ ✓ Data Security ✓ ✓ Info Protection Process ✓ ✓ Maintenance ✓ ✓ Protective Technology ✓ ✓ ✓ DEAnomalies and Events ✓ ✓ ✓ Continuous Monitoring ✓ ✓ ✓ Detection Process ✓ ✓ RSResponse Planning ✓ ✓ Communications ✓ ✓ Analysis ✓ ✓ ✓ Mitigation ✓ ✓ ✓ Improvements ✓ ✓ RCRecovery Planning ✓ ✓ Improvements ✓ ✓ Communications ✓ ✓ Cisco Secure Advisory Services has the right people and process knowledge and best practices to help you understand, plan, and act on all areas of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

White Paper Cisco PublicCisco Secure Solutions for the Identify (ID) Function According to NIST, the purpose of the Identify function is to “develop the organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.” Part of that organizational understanding is visibility into what you have; that is, it’s difficult to protect something if you don’t know that you have it. That’s why Cisco Secure delivers critical discovery capabilities; that is, identifying and categorizing systems, assets, and data on a continuous basis. Let’s take a closer look at each category within the Identify function. ID.AM: Asset Management. NIST defines the Asset Management category’s goal as “the data, personnel, devices, systems, and facilities that enable the organization to achieve business purposes are identified and managed consistent with their relative importance to business objectives and the organization’s risk strategy.” Subcategories include physical device inventories (ID.AM-1) and software application inventories (ID.AM-2). How Cisco Secure solutions map to the Asset Management category:

White Paper Cisco PublicCisco Secure Solutions for the Detect (DE) Function The Detect function helps organizations develop and implement the appropriate activities to quickly identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event. Many cybersecurity incidents go unnoticed for months, allowing hackers ample time to explore your networks, locate sensitive information, and then slowly and carefully exfiltrate it. Cisco Secure defines Time-To-Detection (TTD) for malware analysis as the window of time between the first observation of a file and the detection of an actual threat. Cisco Secure continually seeks to reduce the TTD so that our customers can detect cyber incidents faster than ever (and take corrective action before damage occurs). For more information on Time-To-Detection and many other cybersecurity insights, please see the latest Cisco Cybersecurity Report at www.cisco.com/go/securityreport. Now let’s take a closer look at the Detect function’s categories: DE.AE: Anomalies and Events. NIST defines the Anomalies and Events category’s goal as “anomalous activity is detected in a timely manner and the potential impact of events is understood.” Five subcategories include the establishment and management of network baselines and expected data flows for both systems and users (DE.AE-1), the analysis of detected events to understand attack targets and methods, (DE.AE-2), the aggregation and correlation of event data (DE.AE-3), the determination of impact (DE.AE-4), and the establishment of incident alert thresholds (DE.AE-5). How Cisco solutions map to the Anomalies and Events category: 
- Secure Endpoint and Secure Malware Analytics: A lightweight solution that analyzes files for malware threats both at network entry time and continuously. Oftentimes malicious code enters the network as seemingly harmless files, like a simple PDF email attachment or a downloaded Flash file. But once inside the network, these files can begin behaving abnormally — an early sign of advanced malware. Therefore, Cisco Secure Endpoint continuously analyzes application data to understand threat and attack methods (DE.AE-2), assess the potential impact (DE.AE-4), and alerts and quarantines when files become actual malware (DE.AE-5). 
- Secure Network Analytics (with Cognitive): Secure Network Analytics has the ability to learn normal network traffic (data flow) patterns and establishes baselines of expected behavior (DE. AE-1). It analyzes, detects and alerts on network traffic anomalies and suspicious traffic patterns (DE.AE-2 and DE.AE-5). 
- Secure Workload: Secure Workload allows for the detection of anomalous activity and provides dashboards portraying potential impact in an easy-to-understand format. A baseline of network operations and expected data flows is established and managed, detected events are analyzed to understand attack targets and methods, event data are collected and correlated from multiple sources and sensors, impact of events is easily determined and incident alert thresholds are established (DE. AE-1, DE.AE-2, DE.AE-3, DE.AE-4, DE.AE-5). 
- Cloudlock: Cloudlock monitors and controls cloud application data to help set baselines for expected data flows between users and cloud applications (DE.AE-1). 
- Umbrella Secure Internet Gateway: Umbrella SIG platform provides multiple levels of defense against Internet-based threats. The solution integrates secure web gateway, firewall, DNS-layer security, and cloud access security broker (CASB) functionality to protect your systems against threats (DE.AE-2, DE.AE-3, DE.AE-4, DE.AE-5).

NIST defines the Recovery Planning category’s goal as “recovery processes and procedures are executed and maintained to ensure timely restoration of systems or assets affected by cybersecurity events.” This category requires people and process controls, not technical controls. Recall that the recovery plan itself was implemented, managed, and tested in the Protect function through its Information Protection Processes and Procedures (PR.IP) category. Here in the Recover function is where the recovery plan is actually used. Therefore, its sole subcategory is recovery plan execution during or after an event (RC.RP-1). How Cisco solutions map to the Recovery Planning category: 
- Secure Endpoint and Secure Malware Analytics: Non-Technical Control Area 
- Secure Network Analytics (with Cognitive): Non-Technical Control Area 
- Secure Workload: Non-Technical Control Area 
- Cloudlock: Non-Technical Control Area

White Paper Cisco PublicRC.IM: Improvements. NIST defines the Improvement category’s goal as “recovery planning and processes are improved by incorporating lessons learned into future activities.” This category requires people and process controls, not technical controls. Subcategories include the incorporation of lessons learned into recovery plans (RC.IM-1) and ongoing updates of recovery strategies (RC.IM-2). How Cisco solutions map to the Improvements category: 
- Secure Endpoint and Secure Malware Analytics: Non-Technical Control Area 
- Secure Network Analytics (with Cognitive): Non-Technical Control Area 
- Secure Workload: Non-Technical Control Area 
- Cloudlock: Non-Technical Control Area

White Paper Cisco PublicRC.CO: Communications. NIST defines the Communications category’s goal as “restoration activities are coordinated with internal and external parties, such as coordinating centers, Internet Service Providers, owners of attacking systems, victims, other Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), and vendors.” This category requires people and process controls, not technical controls. Subcategories include public relations management (RC.CO-1), post-incident reputation repair (RC.CO-2), and internal communication with stakeholders and executive management about recovery activities (RC.CO-3). How Cisco solutions map to the Communications category: 
- Secure Endpoint and Secure Malware Analytics: Non-Technical Control Area 
- Secure Network Analytics (with Cognitive): Non-Technical Control Area 
- Secure Workload: Non-Technical Control Area 
- Cloudlock: Non-Technical Control Area
