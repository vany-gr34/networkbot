network troubleshooting,"i searched in this sub for the past couple of hours for past posts about network performance and resources to become better at creating performant networks or troubleshooting performance related issues. personally, i feel like i have a good handle on network availability and security in terms of design, implementation, and maintenance. however, i cannot say the same about performance. so does any one have good recommendations in the realm of network performance? i am looking to level up in that area but i dont know where to start. || make sure your mtu sizes are good. anything beyond that is probably not a network issue. || look for the section network performance related resources at the bottom of learn about bdp and nagle algorithm good luck."
network troubleshooting,"hello fellow network admins, how did you become a good network admin? i tend to struggle in my role at times, ive been in networking for about a year and at my current position for about 6 months and i struggle with complex network issues. i can troubleshoot and take care of minor networking tasks like programming ports, creating small config changes, and managing our aps, but there are times when things are just not working, and ill sit there for 12 hours just staring at a config going over it multiple times just to be stumped and not find anything. i usually google things but there are times i cant seem to find a good resolution to my problem which leads me to ask the lead network admin just for them to solve the issue in a few minutes. i feel there is a huge gap in knowledge due to them building the network and me going into an exisiting network that is pretty large and critical. do i suck? do my research skills suck? do i need more time? do i need to study more and read about networking more than i already have? i lack in the implementation i understand how a lot of things in networking well work but its when the time comes to put that into practice that i choke and dont seem to know anything. any advice helps || you need more time and to use your log file. running config for examples. build a command list from troubleshooting. experience is gained over time exploring these headaches. takes years to do things in minutes. rock out with your cli out mate || 6 months is not a long time at all. it seems like you have a desire to get better and want to learn. just keep that up and give it some more time and you will get there eventually. theres always going to be someone who knows more than you so dont let that discourage you. || when the lead admin fixes them. do you follow up with them? what was the issue? how did you fix it?"
network troubleshooting,"i saw a technical support role and i like the idea of going deep down in a product line, learning technical chops, but at the same time, i cant help but wonder wouldnt most cases you see related to some bug or need some hot fix if you work in tac or technical support for network vendors like ciscofortinetpalo altojuniper etc, what percentage of your work is due to a bug and how much do you troubleshoot for like a design issue or deepdown on protocol? do they give you formal trainings or just give access to some study links and labs and throw you away into the fire? basically, do you enjoy your role or its just find bugs, rinse and repeat? and for those who moved away from tac to another role, or joined an enterprise, where you able to catchup back to being a generalist? || im not vendor tac but msp tac, but stuff i send to vendor personally is things not working how i expect sometimes bug, sometimes own stupid. but we are fairly adept engineers, there are customers that have config problems. generally you dont go to vendors for design help, they have professional services for that, but they will point out when you have done something wrong. the thing about any sort of troubleshooting you need to understand the specific protocol to be able to find stuff, and understanding what the customer is expecting. || i was at brocade and then extreme when they bought that part of brocade, having previously worked for t1 and t2 isps. being able to get into the weeds on a variety of hardware and software was interesting to begin with. i got access to tools and troubleshooting guides that just arent available to the public which let you pull some pretty deep diagnostic data out of a system. we also had big labs to build customer networks in to replicate customer issues. the majority of the time though we were diagnosing new bugs, or identifying existing bugs in older software, and very rarely correcting customer design or deployment. eventually i got tired of working in tac and being limited to a single vendor, and despite being involved in a couple of cool projects i decided i was happier in the sp space. training at brocade was really poor, just punted us over to global knowledge for generic product training, extreme wasnt much better but as i left they started a big push for in house training and that looks to have been a success. as for when i left, because the part of brocadeextreme i was in dealt primarily with isps i never really lost touch with my mplsbgpospf abilities, and i reckon i even improved a bit to be honest. so it depends heavily on what part of tac you join. if you ended up looking after wireless or security products you probably would find your skills atrophy a bit but if youre a good engineer im sure youd get it back quick enough. || depends on what level. usually when you start its at tier 2 at the vendors i worked at this was the terminology anyway. tier 1 being outsourced support. at tier 2 the cases you get are still maybe 80 configurationdesign issues of varying complexity. weird interoperability issues between vendors. the rest might be diagnosing some bug thats already been fixed and telling them what version to upgrade to or implement workaround. light lab replications. if you have reason to think its a new bug or one that doesnt have a fix out yet it gets kicked to tier 3. tier 3 is a mix of complex nonbug issues and actual bugs. more and complex lab replications, get deeper into the protocols. then if you think its a bug, file the bug with engineering and then you have to manage the customer side of the bug lifecycle. theres quite a bit of formal training both for the product and soft skills. product configuration training, basically the same thing youd take to get a basic certification in whatever product line you are working on. plus various internal trainings for aspects of the product architecture. maybe a month or so of just training if memory serves? then there is ongoing training as new productssoftware is released. taking cases and calls is a ramp up period. i enjoyed parts of it, but i enjoy sifting through log files and stack traces to identify bugs. in my experience it can tend to be more of a call center job vibe than other network engineering type gigs. at tier 2 you are on the phones talking to customers a lot. there can be a heavy emphasis on case throughput, phone schedules, case backlog management. it can be a heavy workload im sure this depends on the vendor you work for."
network troubleshooting,"i am going to study it engineering and networking have a mcse on windows nt from 2000, so a bit rusty. i now have macs and are not up to date on the tools to use! i want all the tools to scan networks and to troubleshoot it. can someone please point me in the direction of some good apps to get to know? there is a jungle out there and after a search online, i get too many apps and free stuff etc so im confused to what to use. thanks in advance || iterm2 better terminal eaptest best solution to test eap to radius paid serial serial emulation, supports almost all usb2serial adapters out of the box without drivers paid wireshark pcap analyzing wifi explorer pro 3 wifi scanner with lots of data paidlesser free version available airtool 2 easiest wifi packet capture paid lanscan quickly find hosts in subnet paidlesser free version available bruno the better postman podman desktop docker desktop is not really free, this is cyberduck sftp client || honestly, one of my favorite native macos features is the hold option key click on wifi menu bar icon. shows ip address, default gw, security type, rssi and mcs index etc. super useful in quick troubleshooting || install homebrew and enjoy all the cli tools.. too many to list"
network troubleshooting,"i was troubleshooting a routing issue on a vps of ours and i saw a lot of hsrpv1 packets coming over the network. it looked like this 120153.223306 eth0 m ip xx.xx.xx.xx.hsrp 224.0.0.102.hsrp hsrpv1 120153.279718 eth0 m ip xx.xx.xx.xx.hsrp 224.0.0.102.hsrp hsrpv1 120153.353355 eth0 m ip xx.xx.xx.xx.hsrp 224.0.0.102.hsrp hsrpv1 120153.359891 eth0 m ip xx.xx.xx.xx.hsrp 224.0.0.102.hsrp hsrpv1 120153.400567 eth0 m ip xx.xx.xx.xx.hsrp 224.0.0.102.hsrp hsrpv1 120153.448598 eth0 m ip xx.xx.xx.xx.hsrp 224.0.0.102.hsrp hsrpv1 120153.503772 eth0 m ip xx.xx.xx.xx.hsrp 224.0.0.102.hsrp hsrpv1 120153.633493 eth0 m ip xx.xx.xx.xx.hsrp 224.0.0.102.hsrp hsrpv1 120153.649417 eth0 m ip xx.xx.xx.xx.hsrp 224.0.0.102.hsrp hsrpv1 each one of the ips were unique. doing a lookup on them showed that they belonged to my vps provider and i suspect these are ips on their routers doing hsrp. is this a misconfiguration on their part that i am even seeing this? from a security perspective are they doing something wrong by letting me see these packets? || hsrp uses multicast. any hosts on the same segment will get these packets. hopefully they use authentication to join the hsrp group. || they have all of those subnets configured on whatever shared vlan your server is on, and theyre all doing hsrp. it is absolutely normal for link local multicast to be spammed everywhere on a particular segment."
network troubleshooting,"hi everyone, im encountering an issue since migrating our network infrastructure to cisco sdaccess. a significant portion but not all of our windows pcs, when connected only via ethernet cable not wifi, start experiencing what appears to be an ipv6 multicast storm. symptoms high cpu usage 100, leading to system freezes. wireshark captures show continuous icmpv6 neighbor discovery multicast traffic between affected pcs. the issue occurs even though ipv6 is not explicitly configured or enabled on the network interface card settings of the affected pcs. this problem did not exist on our previous network infrastructure. temporary workaround manually disabling the ipv6 protocol entirely on the pcs network adapter settings resolves the issue for that specific machine. troubleshooting weve engaged cisco and microsoft support, but havent found a definitive solution yet. questions 1. has anyone else experienced similar ipv6 multicastneighbor discovery storms specifically after implementing cisco sdaccess? 2. what could be the potential root cause within the sdaccess fabric e.g., control plane, l2 flooding, specific configurations? 3. what further investigation steps can i take within the sdaccess environment dna center, switches, ise or on the clientside to pinpoint the source? any insights or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated. thanks. || l2 flooding could be a issue here. but also not that much information to make a conclusion. do you have l2 flooding enabled on your ip pool for your windows clients and so why? || yes i think its an intel nic driver bug that you have triggered. it only happens over a wired connection. disabling ipv6 is the workaround. try downgrading or upgrading the nic drivers. but honestly, if you dont use ipv6, just disable it as the permanent solution. || the issue occurs even though ipv6 is not explicitly configured or enabled on the network interface card settings of the affected pcs. can you clarify what you mean by this? because later on you say you are disabling ipv6 on the interface. do you mean that you dont have ipv6 configured on the network and that devices just with ipv6 ticked on the network adapter experience the problem? there is a saying, if you dont configure ipv6 on your network, someone else will do it for you. modern systems make extensive use of linklocal multicast behind the scenes so most ipv4 only networks still have significant ipv6 traffic that network admins are unaware of. this problem did not exist on our previous network infrastructure. im assuming that you have checked for the usual culprits of loops, errant port mirrors or crosspatched vlans? have you got ipv6 firsthop security enabled on all of you access ports? have you got any of the storm control features enabled? a significant portion but not all of our windows pcs, when connected only via ethernet cable whats common about these hosts? same vlan? same switch? whats your minimum reproducible example?"
network troubleshooting,"i have a network with a number of computers, ip phones, cameras on the same network, no vlan. i started having issues with a few of the ip phones dropping out and not talking to the pbx. i ended up power cycling the pbx and all of the poe switches. while troubleshooting i noticed four of the ip cameras no longer connected. i tried resetting them and they will not respond to a ping at all. static ip. i brought the cameras on to their own test network and they respond fine to a ping, and i am able to interface with them. i am able to assign a computer on the original network the ip of the camera that was not working and it pings fine with no dropped packets. if i change the ip of the camera to an empty ip and put it on the original network it does the same thing and will not respond to a ping. i have five cisco layer 2 switches in the flat network. i have never ran in to a situation like this one. any help is appreciated. || if you have catalyst switches. do show mac address table and compare with the arp table. also do a packet capture of your ping and see if the devices are responding to your arp requests. some thing on the network is likely interfering, the way to find it is packet captures and following the mac tables of the switches."
network troubleshooting,"i have problem in title. i want to migrate aps to meraki cloud from existing network and i found this presentation after upgrading system to 17.9.6 option to migrate ap has appeared but there are no entries there. i checked the inventory and have no misconfigured aps in either category, additionally i reapplied country setting just to make sure. what could be wrong here? after googling, i dont see any troubleshooting options, everyone assumes that if country is ok, it should work. guide is new last month, though i see that migrating the wlc itself is now requiring higher version 17.12. anyone can confirm if that it is the reason? i would prefer to avoid upgrade of big version in current time as i wont have comfort of any longer maintenance periods till summer. || "
network troubleshooting,"i need to pick up a device to quickly help troubleshoot network drops. ive used the netally devices over the years but this time im spending my own money so im looking at either the nettool.io or the pocketethernet. i know i could do all of the same stuff with a laptop but thats not always practical. anyone have experience with both and can recommend one over the other? edit decided to go with the netool. pocketethernet seems to have a sketchy history of not supporting users abandoning v1 of their device. || i have both, the pockethernet is larger, but i actually prefer the app more than the net tool non pro. the non pro nettool used to communicate over bluetooth, where it appears they updated it to connect over wlan, it takes couple of tries to get it to connect and pull info.. which could just be an ios issue. it is nice to pull something out of your pocket and get lldp, external ip, some baseline latency and default gw || i have both, and use both for different tasks. the pockethernet mainly for cable stuff wiremaptdrtone, and the netool for connectivity stuff. i dont particularly like the pockethernet ap, where you have to unselect and reselect every test you want to run. it drives me crazy when im testing multiple cables. sometimes its pretty handy to have a wifi hotspot and a wifi serial console with the netool. || isnt the pocket ethernet basically unsupported now?"
network troubleshooting,"hi all, tldr looking for wireless solutions. installing aps that will expand up to around 100200 users in a 20 acre campground. i am fairly network savvy but dont work directly in the industry anymore, so looking for input on what system to go with. opening a 20 acre campground in upstate ny with an expected 25 spots100 users on the wifi once fully built. starting with just 4 spots on the first 5 acres. i have conduit pulled from a main shed to 2 stub up areas where i was going to put aps and breaker boxes as well as another ap at the second shed so 4 total to start. i was going to use fiber and at each stub up have a fiber repeater with a 2 rj45 poe ports. one for an ap and one for a security camera the lines that stub up also continue to the next shed where i will come out with additional lines for the next building phase. the 3rd ap will be in the middle of this set of spots with a max distance of 150ft to the furthest spot. shed1stub1stub2shed2future everyone seems to hate ubiquiti aruba? edit layout picture expires 46 the data conduit buried is 6ft deep and 1 14. it comes up at the points shown in yellow. distance between is 160ft to stub1, 200ft to stub 2 between the sites and then 250ft to the shed camp link remsen, ny. there is a youtube video showing the layout of the sites and you can see where i brought the electrical and data conduits up. thank you everyone for the feedback so far! i want to do this right and will spend more to do so, but dont want to blow a bunch of unnecessary money. edit2 yeah, ill pull fiber for each ap back rather than chaining it. it will make for better survivability and troubleshooting, plus very scalable in the future. i still have not settled on an ap and firewall solution yet. here is what aps the group is talking about so far aruba ruckus mikrotik ubiquity || hardwire every ap dont wirelessly mesh anything. sounds like that shouldnt be a problem with a greenfield environment like this. if you do have a spot that you cant hardwire an ap for some reason use a separate point to point radio to feed the infrastructure at the far end. || your backhauls and layer 2 management will be crucial to good stability and performance. how you chose to control guest connection speeds and access payments will be equally critical to the design. until you can answer these two questions, both driving influencing the design of one another, you should not proceed with anything else. || we do what youre doing for 25ish rv parks. ubiquity aps ubiquity controller and hardwire everything. its cheap and reliable by comparison to your other choices just remember that rvs are technically tin cans with wheels on them so you have to have a higher density of aps than you think you need in order to get through the side of a provost coach with metalized windows and all metal exterior. your goal should be to get a 60dbm signal strength inside of the coaches which wont happen if your aps are 350 ft away. you have a lot of acreage there youll probably need more aps than you think"
