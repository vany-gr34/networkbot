 Product Overview Supervisor Engines 1-28Catalyst 4500 Series Swit ches Installation Guide 78-14409-08When two Supervisor Engine Vs are pres ent in a Catalyst 4507R and Catalyst 4510R, all four uplinks are active on both Primary (active) and Secondary (standby) supervisor engines by default, or two uplinks will be active in a nonredundant configuration. This limits access to slot 10 on the Catalyst 4510R to ports 3 and 4 only. You can only use the 2-port Gigabit Ethernet switching module (WS-X4302-GB) or the Access Gateway Module (WS-X4604-GWY) in slot 10 (flex-slot), when a Supervisor Engine V is used. 10-Gigabit Ethernet Uplink Ports The 10-Gigabit Ethernet uplink ports oper ate in full-duplex mode only, and are only on the WS-X4516-10GE and WS-X4013+10GE. These ports use the hot-swappable 10GBASE X2 optical tran sceivers. The X2s have SC connectors to interface with multimode fiber (M MF) and single-mode fiber (SMF) cable. On a Catalyst 4510R with a Supervisor Engine V-10GE, the user has the option to use either four Gigabit Ethernet uplinks using SFPs or two 10-Gigabit Ethernet uplinks using X2s. The user also has the option of using the Gigabit Ethernet and 10-Gigabit Ethernet uplinks simultaneously. With this option, the tenth slot can only support the WS-X4302-GB switching module. On a Catalyst 4507R, the user can use the Gigabit Ethernet uplinks and 10-Gigabit Ethernet uplinks simultaneously. When two Supervisor Engine V-10GEs are present in a Catalyst 4510R or Catalyst 4507R switch, or two Supervisor Engine II-Plu s 10GEs are present in a Catalyst 4507R, one X2 uplink is active on both the primary (active) and secondary (standby) supervisor engines by default, or two uplinks will be active in a nonredundant configuration. SFP Ports Gigabit Ethernet SFP ports operate in fu ll-duplex mode only and are present on the WS-X4013+TS, WS-X4516-10GE and WS-X4013+10GE supervisors, as well as some switching modules. These ports use the 1000BASE-SX, 1000BASE-LX, Cisco Coarse Wave Division Multiplexing (CWDM ) SFPs, 1000BASE-T SFP, and 1000BASE-ZX SFP. SFP connectors vary with interface type and may use multimode fiber (MMF), single-mode fiber (SMF) cable, or copper Ethernet cables.
 1-29Catalyst 4500 Series switches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Product Overview Supervisor Engines Ethernet Management Port The Ethernet management port can be used (in ROMMON mode only) to recover a switch software image that has been corrupted or destroyed due to a network catastrophe. When using Cisco IOS Release 12 .2(50)SG or later, this port can also perform the same functions as the consol e port. For earlier Cisco IOS software releases, this port is not active wh ile the switch is operating normally. CONSOLE Port The CONSOLE port has an EIA/TIA-232 RJ-45 connector. The CONSOLE port allows you to perform the following functions: Configure the switch from the CLI Monitor network statistics and errors Configure SNMP agent parameters Note EIA/TIA-232 was known as recommended standard RS-232 before its acceptance as a standard by the Electroni c Industries Alliance (EIA) and Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA). RESET Button The RESET button is used to restart the switch. Note Use a paper clip or other small, pointed object to press the Reset button. CompactFlash Port The CompactFlash port accepts a Type 1 CompactFlash card. You can use it for file transfer tasks such as loading a new software image. The CompactFlash card is optional, and can be obtained from third-party suppliers.

 Product Overview Power Supplies 1-34Catalyst 4500 Series Swit ches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Power Supplies Note For detailed specifications on all Catalyst 4500 series power supplies, refer to the “Catalyst 4500 Series Power Supplies” section on page A-9. A Catalyst 4500 series switch can use a 1000 W, 1300 W, 1400 W, 2800 W (see Figure 1-17 ), or 4200 W (with two inputs, see Figure 1-18 ) AC-input power supply, a 1400 W DC-input power supply with integrated PEM (see Figure 1-19 ), or a 1400 W DC multiple-input power supply (see Figure 1-20 ). The power supplies are hot-swappable. If you have power supplies of different types installed in the two bays, only one will be active and some power features will not be available. The power supply in the left bay is PS1, the one in the right bay is PS2. The AC-input power supply has a power cord that connects each power supply to the site power source. The DC-input power supply is equipped with a input terminal block that is directly co nnected to the site power wiring. Each power supply has an ON/OFF switch that supplies power to the switch. For information on removing and replacing power supplies, see the “Removing and Replacing the Power Supply” section on page 4-2.

In redundant mode, the two power supplies must have identical inputs. You will need to power down the switch to upgrade to or away from this power supply. The 1400 W DC input power supply (either single or triple-input) may be used with the Catalyst 4500 Series AC Powe r Shelf. Documentation for the Catalyst 4500 Series AC Power Shelf is at http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switch es/lan/catalyst4500/hardware/configur ation/notes/78_15068.html Catalyst 4500 series switches support one power supply and an optional redundant power supply. Each AC power supply has an individual power cord and status LEDs. Systems with redundant power supplies will share the load, with each unit providing approximately one-half of the total load. For information about configuring your switch for redundant and combined modes, refer to the software configuration guide for your switch. The Catalyst 4510R requires at least 1400 W of input power. (The 1000 W AC and 1300 W AC power supplies for the Catalyst 4500 series will fit and function in a Catalyst 4510R; however, power management may be required in high density configurations.) Cisco recommends the use of the 1400 W DC, 1400 W AC, and 2800 W AC power supplies for the Catalyst 4510R.Captive screws 120562
 1-37Catalyst 4500 Series switches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Product Overview Power Supplies When power is removed from one power supply on a Catalyst 4500 series switch that has two power supplies, the redundant power feature causes the second power supply to produce full power. To replace a power supply, see the “Removing and Replacing the Power Supply” section on page 4-2. Power Supply LEDs Table 1-7 describes the power supply LEDs. Ta b l e 1-7 Power Supply LEDs LED Color/State Description INPUT OK Indicates whether the input voltage is within the required range: Green Input voltage is within the required range. Flashing Input voltage is present, but is below required range. Off Input voltage is below the required range or the power supply is off. OUTPUT FAIL Red Output voltage is not within the specified range. Off Output voltage is within the specified range. FAN OK Indicates the status of the power supply fans: Green The fans are operational. Off The fans are not operational. In-line PWR (for 1400 W DC single input power supplies)Green –48 V passthru output voltage is enabled and is greater than –39 V and less than –60 V. Off Indicates any of the following: Passthrough breakers are not enabled. DC input is less than –40.5 V. One or more –48 V outputs is less than –39 V. Amber Passthru breakers are enabled and input voltage exceeds –60 V.
 Product Overview Power Supplies 1-38Catalyst 4500 Series Swit ches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Power Supply Fan Each power supply has a built-in fan. Air enters the front of the power supply (power-input end) and exits through th e back. An air dam keeps the airflow separate from the rest of the chassis, whic h is cooled by the system fan assembly. Load-Sharing Feature When you install and turn on a second power supply on a Catalyst 4500 series switch, it provides approximately one-half of the required power to the system. If one power supply fails, the other power supply immediately assumes full power to maintain uninterrupted system operation. Note Load sharing works only when both power supplies in the chassis are the same type. When you install a redundant power supply, load sharing and fault tolerance are enabled automatically; no additional software configuration is required. Environmental Monitoring Feature With the environmental mon itoring and reporting feature, you can keep your system running by resolving adverse environmental conditions before loss of operation. The power supply monitors its own internal temperature and voltages. In the event of excessive internal temperature, the power supply shuts down to prevent damage. When the power supply returns to a safe operating temperature, it restarts. If the power supply output voltage is not within the specified range, the LED labeled OUTPUT FAIL will light. An instance of substantial output overvoltage can shut down the power supply. An instance of substantial input overvoltage (greater than –75 V DC continuous) can damage the power supply input circuitry and can cause it to shut down permanently.
 1-39Catalyst 4500 Series switches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Product Overview Power Supplies For a 1400 W DC power supply, the main power switch has an input range of –40.5 to –72 V DC, while the –48 V PoE operates over a range of –40.5 to –56 V DC. The PoE either fails to start or s huts down if exposed to greater than –56 V DC input. PoE recovers after you re cycle input power within the proper voltage range. If the PoE shuts down due to input overvoltage (greater than –56 V DC), the main converter section does not shut down. The supervisor engine monitors the stat us of each power supply and provides a status report through the switch software. For more details on how the supervisor engine monitors the power supplies, refer to the “Environmental Monitoring and Power Management” chapter of the Catalyst 4500 Series Switch Cisco IOS Software Configuration Guide. 1400 W DC Triple-input Power Supply Operational Modes The C4500 1400 W DC Triple Input SP Power Supply (data only) allows added redundancy by providing terminals for two DC inputs rated at 15 A and one rated at 12.5 A per power supply. This power supply has five operational modes depending on the inputs receiving power. When all three inputs are active, at input voltages greater than –44.0 V DC, the power supply delivers 1400 W maximum total output. Table 1-8 provides output information for these modes, given a single supply.

To determine total maximum input power to a supply, add up the active individual module input power ratings. Table 1-9 provides output information for these modes, given two supplies working in combined mode. Table 1-10 provides output information for these modes, given two supplies working in redundant mode.

A Catalyst 4503 only is shown in the examples. Power Flow Figure 1-21 shows power ingress and flow through the system. Figure 1-21 Power Flow Power enters the switch through the po wer supplies. Several types of power supplies are available, depending on the power needs for your system and the power type available on your site. Al l power supplies provide a 3.3 V circuit (shown as a dash-dot line) to the compon ents on the backplane and a 12 V circuit (shown as a solid line) that is carried over the backplane to the fans, supervisor engine, and switching modules.

Note The Supervisor Engine II-Plus TS has inte rnal DC-to-DC conver ters that use the 12 V circuit to provide PoE to powered devices connected to the Supervisor engine only. If your system has a Supervisor Engine II-Plus TS in slot 1, you still need a PoE-enabled power supply to provide PoE to the other slots. All Catalyst 4500 series switches suppor t dual power supplies, configurable as combined mode or redundant mode. In combined mode, the switch has available the combined rated wattage of both power supplies, less some expected efficiency loss. In redundant mode, one power supply provides power to the system and the other supply is on standby should there be a failure in either the power supply or the input voltage source it is connected to. Power over Ethernet The Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series switch es support the Cisco pre-standard and 802.3af standard for PoE on 10/100 or 10/100/1000 ports, enabling customers to support telephones, wireless base stations, video cameras, and other appliances. PoE makes it possible to place devices in unique locations without having to provide new outlets and costly electrical circuits. PoE also enables businesses to isolate critical devices on a single power system so that the entire system can be supported by uninterruptable power supply (UPS) backup. All new Cisco Catalyst PoE line cards can support 15.4 W of power per port simultaneously. Not only do the cards support the IEEE standard, including the optional power classifications, but the Cisco pre-standard power implementation is also supported to help ensure backward compatibility with existing Cisco powered devices. The cards are compatib le with any chassis and supervisor engine. Most importantly, the Catalyst 4500 series switch has the power supplies and accessories to support 15.4 W per port on every port simultaneously in any fully loaded chassis. (This requires an external power shelf or a 4200 W dual-input power supply.)
 1-45Catalyst 4500 Series switches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Product Overview System Architecture PoE Over-subscription With the advent of powered devices requir ing as much as 15.4 W and the different combinations of power supplies and chassis port densities, it becomes quite possible to over-subscribe the PoE capacity of the power supplies. This temporary over-subscription typically occurs when a power supply config ured in combined mode fails or when the user has not kept track of the powered devices and plugs in one too many. The best practice is to design a PoE system in which all devices receive the power needed at all times. When a power supply is over-subscribed—more power is being drawn from it than it can supply—the power supply shuts down. There are several ways to predictably manage a temporary PoE over-subscription: 1.Configure unused ports to never receive PoE. This prevents a user from inadvertently plugging a powered device into a port and causing problems for other powered devices. 2.Configure ports to be in static mode. This is for ports that have highest priority, such as phones for executives or wireless access points. If ports need to be disabled because of a power shortage, auto ports are disabled before static ports. 3.Configure the maximum wattage on ports to be less than the default, based on the maximum power consumption of the powered device. This disallows devices demanding unexpected amounts of power and also stretches the finite resources of the power supplies. For example, the default port wattage is 15.4 W. By configuring a maximum of 7 W, twice as many PoE powered devices can be supported wi th the same power supply. PoE Line Cards The Cisco Catalyst 4500 series offers line cards, power supplies, and accessories required to deploy and operate a standards-based PoE internetwork. PoE provides –48 V DC power over standard Category 5 unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cable up to 100 meters when an IEEE 802.3afcompliant or Cisco pr e-standard powered device is attached to the PoE line card port. Instead of requiring wall power, attached devices such as IP phones, wi reless base stations, video cameras, and other IEEE-compliant appliances can use power provided by the PoE line cards. This capability gives network administrators centralized control over power and eliminates the need to install outlets in ceilings and other out-of-the-way places where a powered device may be installed.
 Product Overview System Architecture 1-46Catalyst 4500 Series Swit ches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Although references to “PoE,” “inline-power,” and “voice” power supplies and line cards are synonymous, there are only two versions: Cisco prestandard and IEEE 802.3af compliant. Every Cisco Cataly st 4500 series chassis and PoE power supply supports the IEEE 802.3af stan dard and the Cisco prestandard power implementation ensuring backward compatibility with existing Cisco powered devices. All IEEE 802.3af-comp liant line cards can dis tinguish an IEEE or Cisco prestandard powered device from an unpowered network interface card (NIC), ensuring that power is applied only wh en an appropriate device is connected. All PoE line cards can distinguish an I EEE or Cisco prestandard powered device from an unpowered network interface card (NIC) to ensure power is applied only when an appropriate device is co nnected. With a Cisco PoE network, administrators can depend on a robust network that is safe to deploy and simple to maintain. Deploying PoE on the Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series When the switch is properly configured, implementing PoE is easy when it is used with a Cisco powered device that supports Cisco Discovery Protocol. All PoE line cards automatically detect an attached po wered device the moment it is installed. Also, the switch returns unused port powe r to the system power budget for use by other devices because it su pports the IEEE802.3af optio nal power classifications. The Cisco Catalyst 4500 series offers internal power supplies and external power devices for multiple deployment scenario s. These scenarios include small and large deployments in AC or DC environments for data-only configurations, and scalability of up to 15.4 W per port for PoE configurations. The switches share a common power supply form factor. Each Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series chassis is designed for 1 + 1 power protection while meeting the needs of PoE demands. In addition to power resiliency, the Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series includes 1 + 1 supervisor-engine redundancy (Cisco Catalyst 4507R and Catalyst 4510R only) and software-based fault tolerance. Integrated resiliency in both hardware and soft ware minimizes network downtime, helping ensure workforce productivity, portability, and customer success. All available Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series power supplies can be used for data-only deployments, which typically require just a few hundred watts. For deployments that dictate support for PoE power, Cisco offers several options. The Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series offers se veral internal supplies: 1000 W AC (data only), 1400 W AC (data only), 1300 W (data and PoE), 1400 W DC (data and PoE), 2800 W (data and PoE), and 4200 W AC (data and PoE). When more than 
 1-47Catalyst 4500 Series switches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Product Overview System Architecture 4200 W of redundant data and PoE are required for a Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series chassis in an AC-powered environment, Ci sco offers an extern al AC power shelf that houses two 2500 W AC power supplies. When two power shelves are combined, they can produce 7500 W—the remaining 2500 W supply can be used for N + 1 protection. The Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series has two DC power options; one is optimized for data-only deployments in service provider central offices (part number PWR-C45-1400DC), and the other is used for high-power PoE deployments (part number PWR-C45-1400DC-P). Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series External AC Power Shelf and 1400 W DC Power Supply with Integrated Power Entry Module The external AC power shelf must be used in conjunction with the 1400 W DC power supply. In addition to providing power for the chassis, fans, and non-PoE line cards, the 1400 W DC power supply contains a power entry module (PEM). The PEM is used to pass additional power to the chassis backplane, power demanded by the PoE line cards. The chassis power trace used for PoE is independent from the one used by the supervisor engine(s), fan tray, and backplane componen ts. The 1400 W DC power supply can accept up to 7500 W DC for data and PoE applications. Up to 1400 W can be dedicated for data (supervisor engine, fan tray, etc.), while the remaining power is passed through via the PEM and is used for PoE. When only one external AC power shelf is used (with two 2500 W AC power supplies), it provides the 1400 W DC power supply with 5000 W of DC power in total. When two AC power shelves are st rapped together, the switch can provide up to 7500 W of DC power (3 + 1 redundant). Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series Service Provider DC Power Supply The triple-input 1400 W DC power supply is optimized for service provider or central-office deployments. By providing multiple inputs, the service provider DC power supply enables central-office technicians to customize the output power to meet their application needs. Many central-office deployments require only a fraction of the 1400 W available in the service provider power supply. Low current inputs mean technicians can co nnect the supply to smaller fuses and breakers. The service provider power supp ly makes it possible to deploy a Cisco 
 Product Overview System Architecture 1-48Catalyst 4500 Series Swit ches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Catalyst 4503 with a single 15A circuit. Likewise, it is possible to deploy a fully populated Cisco Catalyst 4510R with two 20A and one 15A circuits rather than a single 60A connection, which often requires rack rewiring. Management Flow Figure 1-22 shows management and status information flow through the system. Figure 1-22 Management Flow Each system component has an EEPROM that identifies it to the supervisor engine over a serial connection on the backplane, which also passes along information like temperature, fan speed, power draw per slot and port, and port activity. LED status information is also sent to the supervisor engine, which makes it available to an administrator through a terminal connection or management software.

Cisco NetFlow Services is integral to the Supervisor Engine V-10GE. Switching Traffic Flow Figure 1-23 shows switching traffic flow through the system. 
 Product Overview System Architecture 1-50Catalyst 4500 Series Swit ches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Figure 1-23 Switching T raffic Flow Frames flow into the switch through interfaces on the switching modules. Each switching module connects to a mux/buff er on the backplan e that supports a connection of up to 6 Gbps up (Tx) to the supervisor engine and 6 Gbps from (Rx) the supervisor engine. When a frame reache s the supervisor engine, it is examined and either sent out of an interface in one of the other slots, or out of the uplink on the supervisor engine. Over-subscription Switching modules that have 24 or 48 Gigabit Ethernet (1000BASE-T) ports over-subscribe on a Catalyst 4500 switch by grouping the ports with an additional mux/buffer on the switching module, which creates a single, nonblocking, full-duplex Gigabit Ethernet connection to the internal switch fabric. For each group of ports, frames received are buffered and sent to the common Gigabit MUX MUX Clock 1209212 Gigabit Ethernet uplinks 24 Gbps 6 Gbps up / 6 Gbps down 6 Gbps up / 6 Gbps down 1000BASE-T 1:11000BASE-T 8:1 (oversubscribed) (Supervisor Engine)

If the amount of data received for a port begins to exceed buffer capacity, flow control sends pause frames to the remote port to temporarily stop traffic and prevent frame loss. Each port in the group shares the bandwidth of a Gigabit Ethernet link. However, each port operates independently so that flow control, or configuration of one port, does not block or degrade the performance of another port in that group. Switching modules that have up to six 1000BASE-T ports do not use over-subscription. The amount of over-subscription can be controlled by varying the number of ports used at 1000 Mbps. All ports can use Cisco Gigabit EtherChannel technology or IEEE 802.3ad for high-speed interconnect ion applications. Al l over-subscribed ports use the standard IEEE 802.1x flow control (PAUSE frame) mechanism to control Gigabit Ethernet host traffic. Supervisor Redundancy The Cisco Catalyst 4507R and Catalyst 4510R switches support 1+1 supervisor-engine redundancy for integrated resiliency. Redundant supervisor engines help minimize network downtime. With the support of stateful switchover (SSO), the secondary supervis or engine serves as a backup to immediately take over after a primary supervisor failure. During the switchover, Layer 2 links are maintained transparently without the need to renegotiate sessions. As a result, business-critical ap plications such as Voice-over-IP (V oIP) calls are not dropped. The Nonstop Forwarding (NSF) Aware feature in Cisco IOS software is also supported, providing the ability to interface with NSF-capable devices and to continue forwarding packets as routing information is updated upon a supervisor-engine switchover.

Avoid using such interconnection methods unless the exposed metal parts are in a restricted access location and users and service people who are authorized to access the location are made aware of the hazard. A restricted access area can be accessed only through the use of a special tool, lock and key, or other means of security. Statement 1072 This chapter describes how to prepare your site for the installation of the switch. The information is presen ted in these sections: Electrostatic Discharge, page 2-2 Site Power Requirements an d Heat Dissipation, page 2-4 Power Connection Guidelines for AC-Powered Systems, page 2-5 Site-Planning Checklist, page 2-17 Note See the Site-Planning Checklist at the end of this chapter to help ensure that you complete all site-planning activities before you install the switch. Electrostatic Discharge Electrostatic discharge is common on Category 5E and Category 6 cabling systems. Category 5E and Category 6 cables have higher capacitance than Category 5 cables. As a result, Category 5E and Ca tegory 6 cables can store higher voltages than Category 5 cables and are more pr one to damaging networking equipment if a differential discharge event occur. Unshielded twisted-pair cables can stor e high voltages. Wh en these charged cables are connected to networking equipm ent, energy is discharged into the networking equipment; this is known as electrostatic discharge (ESD). Networking equipment is commonly designed and tested to withstand common mode ESD events of up to 2000 V. The design for the common mode event is based on the expectation that the discharge is delivered to all pins of a port at once. 
 2-3Catalyst 4500 Series switches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Preparing for Installation Electrostatic Discharge Sometimes, voltage is discharged to some of the pins of the connector and not others, or to some pins on the connec tor before others. This is known as a differential discharge event, which can damage the networking equipment being connected. You can take the following measures to prevent ESD cable damage: Ground the cable before connecting the networking equipment. You can create a grounding cable using an RJ-45 patch cable by doing the following: –Bare the wires on one end –Connect the wires to a suit able and safe earth ground –Connect the RJ-45 cable to a female RJ-45 connector Briefly connect all cables to the grounded cable before connecting to networking equipment. Leave cables from the networking eq uipment in the distribution closet connected to ports at user desktops. After you make connections on either side of the cable to networking equipment, the cable will not build up charge. Preventing Electrostatic Discharge Damage Electrostatic discharge (ESD) damage, whic h can occur when electronic cards or components are improperly handled, results in complete or intermittent failures. Port adapters and processor modules consist of printed circuit boards that are fixed in metal carriers. Electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and connectors are integral components of the carrier. Although the metal carrier helps to protect the board from ESD, us e a preventive antistatic strap during handling. Following are guidelines for preventing ESD damage: Always use an ESD wrist or ankle strap and ensure that it makes good skin contact. Connect the equipment end of the stra p to an unfinished chassis surface. When installing a component, use any available ejector levers or captive installation screws toproperly seat the bus connectors in the backplane or midplane. These devices prevent accidentalremoval, provide proper grounding for the system, and help to ensure that bus connectors areproperly seated.
 Preparing for Installation Site Power Requirements and Heat Dissipation 2-4Catalyst 4500 Series Swit ches Installation Guide 78-14409-08 When removing a component, use any av ailable ejector levers or captive installation screws to release the bu s connectors from the backplane or midplane. Handle carriers by available handles or edges only; avoid touching the printed circuit boards or connectors. Place a removed component board-sideup on an antistatic surface or in a static shielding container. If you plan to return the component to the factory, immediately place it in a static shielding container. Avoid contact between the printed circu it boards and clothing. The wrist strap only protects components from ESD voltages on the body; ESD voltages on clothing can still cause damage. Never attempt to remove the printed circuit board from the metal carrier. Caution For safety, periodically check the resist ance value of the antistatic strap. The measurement should be between 1 and 10 megohm (Mohm). Site Power Requirements and Heat Dissipation This section provides module power requirements and heat dissipation specifications for the Catalyst 4500 series switches. You should verify site power before you install the switch. For more information about power mana gement and planning, refer to the “Environmental Monitoring and Po wer Management” chapter in the Catalyst 4500 Series Switch Cisco IOS Software Configuration Guide version appropriate for your software. Knowing the power requirements is useful for planning the power distribution system needed to support the switch es. You should consider the heat dissipation specifications when estima ting the air-conditioning requirements for an installation.

 2-5Catalyst 4500 Series switches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Preparing for Installation Power Connection Guidelines for AC-Powered Systems Power Connection Guidelines for AC-Powered Systems This section provides guidelines for connecting the Catalyst 4500 series switch AC power supplies to the site power source. Basic guidelines include the following: Make sure each chassis power supply has its own dedicated branch circuit. Size the circuits according to local and national codes. If you are using a 200/240 V AC power source in North America, use a two-pole circuit breaker to protect the circuit. Place the source AC outlet within 6 feet (1.8 meters) of the system and make sure it is easily accessible. Make sure the AC power receptacles us ed to plug in the chassis are the grounding type. The grounding conductors that connect to the receptacles should connect to protective earth ground at the service equipment. Four types of AC-input power supplies are available: 1000 W— Table 2-1 lists the AC-input power cord options, specifications, Cisco part numbers, and shows the different styles of 1000 W AC-input power cord wall plugs that are availa ble for North Ameri ca and international locations as well as the appliance couple r that is attached to the power supply end of the power cord. 1300 W— Table 2-1 lists the AC-input power cord options, specifications, and Cisco product numbers, and shows the different styles of 1300 W AC-input power cord wall plugs that are available for North America or various international locations as well as the appliance coupler that is attached to the power supp ly end of the power cord. Note For North America, the power cord plug types and appliance couplers on the power supplies ar e different for the 1000 W power supplies and the 1300 W power supplies; for other countries, the plugs shown are the same for the 1000 W and 1300 W power supplies.

 2-13Catalyst 4500 Series switches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Preparing for Installation Power Connection Guidelines for DC-Powered Systems Power Connection Guidelines for DC-Powered Systems This section provides the basic gui delines for connec ting the Catalyst 4500 series switch DC-input power supplies to the site power source or AC power shelf: All power connection wiring should conform to local and national codes. DC (–) and DC return (+) terminals ar e evaluated for use with 1/0 AWG wire (1400W DC supply only). The ground terminal is evaluated for use with 6 AWG wire (10 AWG for the multi-input power supply). DC (–) and DC return (+) wire lugs sh all not exceed 0.83 inches in width (0.378 inches for the multi-input power supply). For DC power cables, we recommend that you use commensurately rated, high-strand-count copper wire cable. Connection to the DC-input power supply requires one earth ground cable, one source DC (–), and one source DC return (+). The length of the cables depends on your switch location. These cables are not available from Ci sco Systems. They are available from any commercial cable vendor. The color coding of the source DC po wer cable leads depends on the color coding of the site DC power source. Typically, green or green and yellow indicate that the cable is a ground cable. Because there is no color code standard for source DC wiring, you mu st ensure that the power cables are connected to the DC-input power supply terminal block in the proper (+) and (–) polarity. In some case s, the source DC cable l eads might have a positive (+) or a negative (–) label. This label is a relatively safe indication of the polarity, but you must verify the polarity by measuring the voltage between the DC cable leads. When making the measurement, the positive (+) lead and the negative (–) lead must always match the (+) and (–) labels on the DC-input power supply terminal block.
 Preparing for Installation Power Connection Guidelines for DC-Powered Systems 2-14Catalyst 4500 Series Swit ches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Calculating DC Input Current Complete power usage tables are in the Catalyst 4500 Series Module Installation Guide. To calculate the DC input current needed for data and inline power applications, use the following steps (t he example shows the DC input current requirement in a Catalyst 4503 with a Supervisor Engine II and two WS-X4306-GB modules, and assumes a DC input voltage of -48 VDC): Step 1 Add the power requirement for eac h component in your system. Catalyst 4503 uses 54 W Supervisor Engine II uses 147 W WS-X4306-GB uses 2 X 47 = 94 W Total DC input power = 295 W Step 2 After the entries for all components have been added together, divide that number by the DC input voltage to determine the DC input current. Input current = 295 W/48 VDC = 6.14 A for data only. Step 3 to Step 5 are for applications requiring inline power. If your configuration does not include inline power devices, the DC input current is the result of Step 2. Step 3 If you want to add an inline-capable module (WS-X4148-RJ45V) with 10 inline devices (such as IP Phones) to your syst em, calculate the DC output power sent to inline devices. 10 X 6.3 W = 63 W for inline devices. 6.3 Watts is correct for a Cisco IP phone. Wattage consumption will depend on the inline device used. Step 4 Find the DC input power using the DC output power. 63/.96 (efficiency) = 65 W of DC input power. Step 5 Divide the DC input power by the DC voltage input of –48 V to find the DC input current used by inline devices. 65/48 = 1.4 Amps for inline devices.
 2-15Catalyst 4500 Series switches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Preparing for Installation Ventilation Step 6 Add the DC input current used by data and the DC input current used by inline devices to find the total DC input current. Total DC input current = 6.14 + 1.4 = 7.54 A. Ventilation Planning a proper location for the switch and the layout of your equipment rack or wiring closet is essential for successful system operation. You should install the switch in an enclosed, secu re area, ensuring that only qualified personnel have access to the switch and control of the en vironment. Equipment placed too close together or inadequately ve ntilated can cause system overtemperature conditions. In addition, poor equipment placement can make chassis panels inaccessible and difficult to maintain. The switch operates as a standalone system mounted in a rack in a secure wiring closet. It requires a dry, clean, well-ven tilated, and air-conditioned environment. To ensure normal operation, maintain ambient airflow. If the airflow is blocked or restricted, or if the intake air is too warm, an overtemperature condition can occur. The switch environmental mo nitor can then shut down the system to protect the system components. To ensure normal operation and avoid u nnecessary maintenance, plan your site configuration and prepare your site before installation. After installation, make sure the site maintains an ambient temperature of 0 to 40ºC (32 to 104ºF). It is essential to keep the area around the ch assis as free from dust and foreign conductive material (such as metal flakes from nearby construction activity) as is possible. Multiple switches can be rack-mounted with little or no clearance above and below the chassis. However, when moun ting a switch in a rack with other equipment, or when placing it on the floor near other eq uipment, ensure that the exhaust from other equipment does not blow into the intake vent of the chassis. Cooling air is drawn in through the right side of the chassis. Keep the right side clear of obstructions, including dust a nd foreign conductive material, and away from the exhaust ports of other equipment. Allow at least one foot of clearance for both intake and exhaust air flow, and keep cover plates on unused power supply bays and switching module slots to ensure the air in the chassis flows as designed.
 Preparing for Installation Ventilation 2-16Catalyst 4500 Series Swit ches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Appendix A, “Specifications,” lists the operating and nonoperating environmental site requirements for the switches. To ma intain normal operation and ensure high system availability, maintain an ambient temperature and clean power at your site. The environmental ranges listed in Appendix A, “Specifications,” are those within which the switch will continue to operate; however, a measurement that approaches the minimum or maximum of a range indicates a potential problem. You can maintain normal operation by an ticipating and correc ting environmental anomalies before they exceed the maximum operating range. Calculating System Heat Dissipation To calculate the expected he at dissipation from a switch, add the total amount of power drawn from power supply by the system's configuration, then divide the total amount of power by the efficiency of the power supply. Multiply the result by 3.415 to get the system heat dissipation in BTUs/hr. First example (System without any powered devices): Note All Catalyst 4000/4500 power supplies have different efficiencies, An average efficiency figure of 75% was chosen. Second example (same system but this time with one IEEE class 3 device):Components Output Power 1 - Catalyst 4506 with fans 50 W 1 - Supervisor Engine IV 145 W 1 - WS-X4248-RJ45V with no phones 72 W total output power 267 W Total heat dissipated by system = (267/.75) * 3.415 = 1215 BTUs/hr Components Output Power 1 - Catalyst 4506 with fans 50 W 1 - Supervisor Engine IV 145 W 1 - WS-X4248-RJ45V with no phones 72 W

The grounding lug and associated screws are included with the accessory kit. To make an adequate grounding connection, you will need the following parts and tools: Grounding lug—The grounding lug has two #10 AWG holes spaced 0.63 in center to center. A Panduit LCDX6-10A-L or Pencom EL1033 lug may be used if the lug from the acce ssory kit has been misplaced. Two M4 (metric) hex-head screws. One grounding wire (6 AWG recommended)—The length of the grounding wires depends on the location of your switch within the site and its proximity to proper grounding facilities. Number 2 Phillips screwdriver. Crimping tool—This tool must be large enough to accommodate the girth of the grounding lug when you crimp the grounding cable into the lug. Wire-stripping tool.
 Installing the Switch in a Rack System Ground Connection Guidelines 3-24Catalyst 4500 Series Swit ches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Connecting System Ground and Power This section describes how to connect the Catalyst 4500 series switches to earth ground. The system ground connection is required if FXS modules are installed or if this equipment is installed in a US or European Central Office.You must complete this procedure before connecting system power or turning on your switch. To attach the grounding lug and cable to the grounding pad on your Catalyst 4500 series switch, perform the following steps: Step 1 Using a wire-stripping tool, remove approximately 0.75 inches (19 mm) of the covering from the end of the grounding wire. Step 2 Insert the stripped end of the grounding wire into the open end of the grounding lug ( Figure 3-17 ). Step 3 Using a crimping tool, secure the grounding wire in place in the grounding lug. Step 4 Locate the grounding pad on the switch. See Figure 3-13 for the location of the grounding holes on the Catalyst 4503 switch, Figure 3-14 for the location on the Catalyst 4506 switch, Figure 3-15 for the location on the Catalyst 4507R switch, and Figure 3-16 for the location on the Catalyst 4510R switch. 
 3-25Catalyst 4500 Series switches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Installing the Switch in a Rack System Ground Connection Guidelines Figure 3-17 Connecting System Ground on the Switch Step 5 Remove the label that covers the grounding pad. Step 6 Place the grounding lug against the grounding pad, aligning the holes. Insert the two M4 screws through the holes in the grounding lug and grounding pad (Figure 3-15 and Figure 3-17 ). Ensure that the grounding lug and the attached wire will not interfere with other switch hardware or rack equipment. 79482WS-X4448-GB-RJ45 STATUS 12 1110987654321 14 13 16 15 28 2726 25 24 2322 21 20 19 18 17 30 29 32 31 44 4342 41 40 3938 37 36 35 3433 46 45 48 4710/100BASE-TXETHERNET MULTI-SPEED GIGABIT ETHERNET SWITCHING MODULEWS-X4448-GB-RJ45 STATUS 12 1110987654321 14 13 16 15 28 2726 25 24 2322 21 20 19 18 17 30 29 32 31 44 4342 41 40 3938 37 36 35 3433 46 45 48 4710/100BASE-TXETHERNET MULTI-SPEED GIGABIT ETHERNET SWITCHING MODULE1STATUSWS-X4412-2GB-TX 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 171STATUSWS-X4412-2GB-TX 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 171STATUSWS-X4412-2G B-TX 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 17UPLINK UPLINK CONSOLE 10/100 BASE-TXSTATUSUPLINK UPLINK CONSOLE 10/100 BASE-TXSTATUS Grounding pad Grounding lugWire Screws (M4)
 Installing the Switch in a Rack System Ground Connection Guidelines 3-26Catalyst 4500 Series Swit ches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Step 7 Tighten the screws to secure the grounding lug to the grounding pad. Step 8 Repeat steps 1 through 3 to prepare the other end of the grounding wire and connect it to an appropriate grounding point at your site to ensure adequate earth ground for the switch. Step 9 Connect the power supply cords. The switch comes on when the cords are connected and the power supply on/off switch is on. Note This equipment is suitable for connection to intra-building wiring only. Note If you are using a DC power supply, the DC return connection to this system should remain isolated from th e system frame and chassis (DC-I). This completes the installation of the Catalyst 4500 series switches. At this point you should use a RJ-45-to-RJ-45 rollover cable (not supplied) to connect the console port to a PC that runs terminal em ulation software. Configure your terminal emulation program for 9600 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit. With this console connection, you can configure the switch as discussed in the software configuration guide appropriate fo r your switch’s software release, and monitor the software as the switch goes through its startup routine. Note If meaningless characters (g arbage) are seen during or after the switch bootup, verify that you have the correct baud rate setup on your terminal emulation software. If the situation persists, you ne ed to disconnect the RJ-45-to-RJ-45 rollover cable and replace it with a shie lded cable (Cisco p/n 72-1499-01). The shielded cable eliminates the EMI noise causing th e meaningless characters. The pinout for the console port is detailed in the module installation guide at: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switch es/lan/catalyst4500/hardware/confi guration/notes/OL_25315.html

If you do not hear them, ensure that the fan assembly is inserted completely in the chassis and that the faceplate is flush with the switch back panel. Step 2 The fan tray LED should light and be green. Step 3 If after several attempts the fans do not operate, or if you experience trouble with the installation (for instance, if the captive installation screws do not align with the chassis holes), contact the Cisco TAC for assistance. Replacing Backplane Modules on a Catalyst 4507R or 4510R Switch There are 5 redundancy modules (also called mux buffers) and 1 clock module on a Catalyst 4507R chassis backplane. A Catalyst 4510 has 8 redundancy modules on its backplane. They are accessible fro m the front if the switching modules and supervisor engines are removed. There are two types of redundancy modules, and they are interchangeable. The clock module replacemen t procedure is identical to the redundancy module replacement procedure, the connectors are the same. These modules are not hot-swappable, the switch must be taken out of service to replace them. To replace the backplane modules: Step 1 Make sure you are grounded with an ESD strap. Step 2 Turn off the power to the chassis.

 5-3Catalyst 4500 Series switches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Troubleshooting Problem Solving to the System Component Level Problem Solving to the System Component Level The key to success when troubleshooting the system is to isolate the problem to a specific system component. Your first step is to compare what the system is doing to what it should be doing. Because a startup problem can usually be caused by a single component, it is more efficient to isolate the problem to a subsystem rather than troubleshoot each separate component in the system. The switch consists of the following subsystems: Power supply—Includes the power supplies and power supply fans. If you suspect problems with the power supplies, see the “Troubleshooting the Power Supply” section on page 5-6. Fan assembly—The system fan assemb ly should be operating whenever system power is on. You should be able to hear the fan assembly when the system is operating. If you determine that the fan assembly is not operating, see the “Troubleshooting the Fan Assembly” section on page 5-8. Supervisor engine—The supervisor en gine contains the operating system software, so check the supervisor engine if you have trouble with the system software. Status LEDs on the superv isor engine indicate whether the supervisor engine has initialized correctly. If there is a problem with the supervisor engine, try reseating the supervisor engine in the chassis and restarting the switch. For more information about LED meanings, refer to the “LEDs” section on page 1-27. If the supervisor engine does not boot correctly after reseating and restarting, contact Cisco TAC. See the “Contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center” section on page 5-16. Switching modules—The LEDs labele d STATUS on each switching module indicate whether the switching module has been initialized correctly. The supervisor engine must be operating pr operly before the switching module will initialize. If a switching module is improperly installed in the switch, it will not function, so if the supervisor engine is working but a switching module is not, try reseating the module. For more informations, see the “Troubleshooting Switching Modules” section on page 5-10. If you determine that the switching module is not operating, contact Cisco TAC as described in the “Contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center” section on page 5-16. Troubleshooting Using LEDs to Identify Startup Problems 5-4Catalyst 4500 Series Swit ches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Using LEDs to Identify Startup Problems All system states in the startup sequence are indicat ed using LEDs. By checking the LEDs, you can determine when and wh ere the system failed in the startup sequence. If you have problems after the sw itch is on, refer to the configuration procedures in the software configuration guide for your switch. After you connect the power cords to your Catalyst 4500 series switch, follow these steps to determine whether y our system is operating properly: Step 1 Check the power supply LEDs: The LED labeled GOOD should turn green when power is applied to the supply. The LED should remain on during normal system operation. If the LED labeled GOOD does not light, or if the LED labeled FAIL lights, see the “Troubleshooting the Power Supply” section on page 5-6. Note If a power supply is installed and no t connected to a power source, power supply LEDs will indicate a failure. Step 2 Listen for the system fan assembly. If you do not immediately hear it begin to operate, see the “Troubleshooting the Fan Assembly” section on page 5-8. Step 3 Check that the LEDs on the superv isor engine light as follows: The LED labeled STATUS flashes oran ge once and stays orange during diagnostic boot tests. –It turns green when the module is operational (online). –If the system software is unable to start up, this LED stays orange. –If the LED labeled STATUS on the supervisor engine front panel is red or orange, connect a console to the management port and use the show environment command to check for possible problems. For more information, see the “Troubleshooting Supervisor Engines” section on page 5-13. The Ethernet management port LED turns green when the module is operational (online) and a link is esta blished with another network device. If no signal is detected, the LED labeled LINK turns off.
 5-5Catalyst 4500 Series switches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Troubleshooting Using LEDs to Identify Startup Problems Step 4 Verify that the LEDs labeled STATUS on each switching module are green when the supervisor engine completes initialization. This LED indicates that the supervis or engine and switching modules are receiving power, have been recognized by the supervisor engine, and contain a valid Flash code version. However, this LED does not indicate the state of the individual interfaces on the switching mo dules. If an LED labeled STATUS is red or orange, try reseating the switching module or supervisor engine and restarting the switch. If the problem persists, contact Cisco TAC. See the “Contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center” section on page 5-16. Step 5 If the boot information and system banner are not displayed, verify that the terminal is set for 9600 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit and connected properly to the console port. 
 Troubleshooting Troubleshooting the Power Supply 5-6Catalyst 4500 Series Swit ches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Troubleshooting the Power Supply To help isolate a power subsystem problem, follow these steps: Step 1 Check whether the power supply LED labeled GOOD is on or the LED labeled FAIL is on. (on the DC multi-input power supply, the LEDs are labeled INPUT 1, 2, or 3 or OUTPUT FAIL.) Step 2 If the LED labeled GOOD is off or if the LED labeled FAIL is on, take the following steps: Ensure that the power supply is flush with the back of the chassis. Unplug the power cord, loosen and reinstall the power supply, tighten the captive installation screws, and then plug in the power cord. Step 3 If the LED labeled GOOD remains off, there might be a problem with the AC source or the power cable. Connect the powe r cord to another power source if one is available. Step 4 If the LED labeled GOOD fails to light after you connect the power supply to a new power source, replace the power cord. Note If this unit has more than one power cord, repeat Step 1 through Step 4 for each power input. Step 5 If the LED labeled GOOD still fails to lig ht when the switch is connected to a different power source with a new powe r cord, the power supply is probably faulty. Replace the power supply. Step 6 If the LED labeled FAN OK fails to light when the switch is connected to a power source with a known good power cord, ther e is a malfunction in the fan that cools the power supply. Replace the power supply. Step 7 If a second power supply is available, install it in the second power supply bay. Step 8 Check that the LED labeled GOOD is on for the additional power supply. Check that the LED labeled FAIL is off. Step 9 If the LEDs are not on, repeat the previous procedure to troubleshoot the second power supply. 
 5-7Catalyst 4500 Series switches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Troubleshooting Troubleshooting the Power Supply If you are unable to resolve the problem, or if you determine that either a power supply or backplane connector is faulty, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) for instructions. Troubleshooting Power Problems using Cisco IOS Check for system messages related to th e power supply, and refer to the system message guide for your software release. You may need to add a power supply or upgrade to a larger one for your current configuration or verify that the switches are set properly. Connect a terminal to the console port, and look for any of the following system messages: C4K_CHASSIS-2-INLINEPOWEROFF C4K_CHASSIS-2-INSUFFICIENTPOWERDETECTED C4K_CHASSIS-2-INSUFFICIENTPOWERSHUTDOWN C4K_CHASSIS-3-INSUFFICIENTPOWER C4K_CHASSIS-3-INSUFFICIENTPOWERSUPPLIESDETECTED C4K_CHASSIS-3-MIXINPOWERDETECTED C4K_IOSMODPORTMAN-3-UNKNOWNPOWERSUPPLY C4K_IOSMODPORTMAN-4-INLINEPOWEROVERMAX C4K_IOSMODPORTMAN-4-INLINEPOWERSUPPLYBAD C4K_IOSMODPORTMAN-4-POWERSUPPLYBAD C4K_IOSMODPORTMAN-4-POWERSUPPLYFANBAD C4K_SUPERVISOR-3-POWERSUPPLYSTATUSREADFAILED C4K_SUPERVISOR-3-POWERSUPPLYSEEPROMREADFAILED C4K_SUPERVISOR-3-POWERSUPPLYSEEPROMINV ALID C4K_SUPERVISOR-4-INLINEVOLTAGEOUTOFRANGE You may also use the show environment status powersupply, show module all, and show power commands to monitor PS status, load, and activity.
 Troubleshooting Troubleshooting the Fan Assembly 5-8Catalyst 4500 Series Swit ches Installation Guide 78-14409-08The 1400 W DC multi-input supply can not be used with other power supply types, but other power supplies in this product line work with the other types during an upgrade. If you mix power supplies in a Catalyst 4500 series chassis, the switch detects the type of power supply in power supply bay 1 (PS1) and ignores the power supply in power supply bay 2 (PS2) while issuing system messages and showing the power supply in bay 2 as in the err-disable state in the output of the show power command. When the power supply in bay 1 is removed, the switch recognizes the power supply in bay 2, and you may then put a new matching power supply in bay 1. Both supplies should now resume normal function. Troubleshooting the Fan Assembly Note All fans must be operating or a failure will occur. Environmental problems may initially appear to be problems with the fan tray. To help isolate a fan assembly problem, follow these steps: Step 1 Check the status LED on the fan tray. If the LED is off and the rest of the system is functioning, the fan tray is not getting power or is not seated correctly on the backplane. If the LED is green, the fans are oper ating normally. There may be conditions impairing fan performance, but they are minimal in impact. If the LED is red, one or more fans have failed. Step 2 Connect a terminal and determine th e fan tray status shown by the show environment status CLI command. Step 3 Look for system messages reporting a temperature problem or problem with the fans. Individual messages may suggest different solutions. Connect a terminal to the console port, and look for any of the following system messages: C4K_CHASSIS-2-INSUFFICIENTFANSDETECTED C4K_CHASSIS-2-INSUFFICIENTFANSSHUTDOWN C4K_IOSMODPORTMAN-4-CRITICALTEMP C4K_IOSMODPORTMAN-4-FANTRAYBAD

Step 5 Determine whether the power supply is functioning properly. See the “Troubleshooting the Power Supply” section on page 5-6. Step 6 Verify that the fan assembly is properly seated in th e backplane by loosening the captive installation screws, removing the fan assembly, and reinstalling it. Step 7 Restart the system. Step 8 Verify that all fans are operating. You should hear the fans at system start. Step 9 If the system is still detecting a fan assembly failure, contact the Cisco TAC for assistance. Troubleshooting Backplane Modules The Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series redunda ncy scheme uses removable redundancy modules (also called mux-buffers), on the passive backplane to switch traffic to the active supervisor engine. There is one redundancy module per switching module. Redundancy modules and a redundant clock ship standard with every Cisco Catalyst 4507R and 4510R chassis. Spare redundancy modules (C4K-MUX= ) and a clock module ( C4K-CLOCK= ) are available for serviceability. The following conditions indicate that you may need to replace the redundancy modules and clock module:
 Troubleshooting Troubleshooting Switching Modules 5-10Catalyst 4500 Series Swit ches Installation Guide 78-14409-08 The switch powers down and stays down for a few minutes to a few days for no clear reason. The output-fail LED on the power supplies are red and no power is delivered to the chassis. The other LEDs on the power supply are green. The Status LEDs on the switching modules and the supervisor engine are flashing green. CPU Utilization LEDs are flashing green or off. If you observe these conditions, contact the Cisco TAC for assistance in ordering replacement redundancy modules and a clock. Troubleshooting Switching Modules Each switching module has one LED labe led STATUS that provides information about the module and one numbered LED labeled LINK for each port on the module.

Some problems will prevent a console connection and will not allow you to use messages in diagnosing a problem. If you are unable to establish a terminal connection and the STATUS LED is red, contact Cisco TAC immediately to order a replacement. Problems with redundant supervisor systems are often due to mismatched active and standby supervisor engines. Redund ancy requires that both supervisor engines be the same model and running the same Cisco IOS release. If one supervisor has a NetFlow service card, the other must as well. Some problems with supervisor engines ar e due to backplane co nnections that are not fully seated. If removing and reinserting the supervisor engine and then restarting the switch does not solve the problem, call Cisco TAC and replace the supervisor engine.
 Troubleshooting Contacting the Cisco Techn ical Assistance Center 5-16Catalyst 4500 Series Swit ches Installation Guide 78-14409-08Some problems can be solved by rese tting the supervisor engine. Use the hw-module module <n> reset power-cycle command to reset a switching module, or remove and re-insert the swit ching module, which resets, restarts and power cycles the switching module. Pressing the reset button on the supervisor engine causes the software to reload, but does not power cycle the supervisor engine. Note When you power-cycle or remove a supervisor engine in a redundant system the other supervisor engine becomes the active supervisor and the ports retain connectivity. In a non-redundant system, all of the switching modules lose connectivity until the supervisor engine is reinserted and completely restarted. The show diagnostics power-on command may provide useful information for some supervisor engine problems. Not all software versions support all supervisor engines. If you are having trouble with a supervisor engine, refe r to the software release notes to be sure that it is supported by your software.
