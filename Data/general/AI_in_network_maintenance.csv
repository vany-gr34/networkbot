AI in network maintenance,"i searched in this sub for the past couple of hours for past posts about network performance and resources to become better at creating performant networks or troubleshooting performance related issues. personally, i feel like i have a good handle on network availability and security in terms of design, implementation, and maintenance. however, i cannot say the same about performance. so does any one have good recommendations in the realm of network performance? i am looking to level up in that area but i dont know where to start. || make sure your mtu sizes are good. anything beyond that is probably not a network issue. || look for the section network performance related resources at the bottom of learn about bdp and nagle algorithm good luck."
AI in network maintenance,"hi everyone, i work for a software company and our company has been pushing us to go all in on ai this year. weve had several meetings and there have been some super neat projects that have been shown by various development teams or things of that nature but i feel like i cant find anything useful that we can point to other than stuff weve been using for years like our ncm or firewall related logs alerting us proactively or what not. today we were told that if we arent using ai that we are being left behind and i feel super discouraged because we get asked by our management that we need to show that we are using ai in our daily tasks but yet other than what i mentioned above i cant point to anything. ive been in it for 20 years and been a network engineer for 11 of those and its not that im resistant to change but i dont know where to really start the network is the heart of everything that everyone uses. how are you using ai in your daily work just looking for examples or maybe think outside of the box i feel like im not seeing the big picture or that one thing of here is something cool you can do and implement thanks for reading. || hey chat gpt, here is my private network configuration data, please dont share it with anyone else || i use ai to write emails back to management. technically, it has no real value beyond barfing out error prone snippets. || i dont."
AI in network maintenance,"i have been searching to try and find an answer but i keep coming up blank. so any thoughts will be appreciated. i have asked both dell software support and dell networking but neither of them has an answer. the networking group does not have any best practice for how to setup the switch for use with hyperv to best take advantage of vlt networking. i have dell pro support plus on all my equipment. the dell network team says it is a hyperv question on how they want it setup. the dell software support says this is a dell networking question and they both think they are independent. i am running hyperv and using powershell to create a virtual set using hypervport for load balancing. i have a 3 node cluster running 75 virtual servers on the cluster set does not support lacp my hyperv host are connected to two dell switches that are running dell os10 setup with vlt all servers are the same the following is an example of one server 1 connected to switch 1 with 2 ports connected to switch 2 with 2 ports all 4 ports on server 1 are in a single set virtual switch i have added host os, cluster network and backup network as virtual nics off the main set so the os sees the host os, cluster network and backup network iscsi is on dedicated nics that are not part of set and are using mpio with a nic connected to each switch. to best handle efficient routing of traffic between virtual servers and fast notification of down link events what is the preferred method of setup from the switch side of the equation. i run 10 rds session host servers using fslogix for profile storage so network latency matters to give my users a good experience. option 1 do nothing on the ports at the switch level. this requires that all traffic be routed and can put a lot of traffic on the backplane of the vlti interface between the switches because it does not optimize traffic. option 2 setup a port channel with lacp set to static. this will communicate to the vlt switches the group of ports are together for routing and notification and not creating loops. my understanding is this also helps with routing of traffic and notification during loss of 1 switch i.e. maintenance windows for switch. option 3 doing an lbfo nic team that does support lacp then apply the set switch to the team was an option but is not the recommended method from microsoft. also this only gives you one vmmq because the set only sees one nic so it cannot take advantaged of all 4 nics for offloading traffic. option 4 some other method best load balancing for vlt switches vnic is the guest nic and pnic is the physical nic currently all my virtual servers have 1 vnic best practice from microsoft is to use hypervport for all 10gb or faster nics. option 1 hypervport this basically sets a vm to a card the distribution is done by the os and just load them up in a round robin fashion. this vnic1 connects to pnic1 vnic2 connects to pnic2 vnic3 connects to pnic3 vnic4 connects to pnic4 vnic5 connects to pnic1 etc. option 2 dynamic the traffic from vnics gets send out on all 4 pnics in round robin but only one pnic can receive traffic. i do not know if it the process is smart enough to know that it is talking with a vm guest that also on the same switch then it would only send out on the pnics that are connected with that same switch. this could generate a lot of traffic on the vlti backplane if half of the packets are coming from the other switch. i must be over thinking this which is not unusual for me but the lack of documentation is pretty astounding considering this technology has been around for 10 years. || vlt seems to be the dell version of vpc. dont do anything on the switches, set is switch independent and works fine as is. || yep. no fancy config on switches. how load is balanced and bandwidth utilized depends on if the port is set to dynamic or hyper v. you should probably use hyperv port for your vms. refer to the guide from lenovo below which details set requirements and setup for hyperconverged. it is the same for converged, but includes rdma setup. microsoft also has documentation on this on learn.microsoft.com. || yes you dont really do any lag or anything. just present the ports and set itself will handle it."
AI in network maintenance,"i have problem in title. i want to migrate aps to meraki cloud from existing network and i found this presentation after upgrading system to 17.9.6 option to migrate ap has appeared but there are no entries there. i checked the inventory and have no misconfigured aps in either category, additionally i reapplied country setting just to make sure. what could be wrong here? after googling, i dont see any troubleshooting options, everyone assumes that if country is ok, it should work. guide is new last month, though i see that migrating the wlc itself is now requiring higher version 17.12. anyone can confirm if that it is the reason? i would prefer to avoid upgrade of big version in current time as i wont have comfort of any longer maintenance periods till summer. || "
AI in network maintenance,"hi everyone, i am working for one very large enterprise company counting 200 locations worldwide. we are using palo alto global protect for remote users, and probably remote networks for later on. also we have cisco and other network vendors in our network. in the last i would say few yearsa decade pa made very good step forward implementing ai and much more tools than earlier..i have noticed pa expansion by listening my friends from others companies and judging by the share market statistics.what do you think, is pa taking bigger part of cake for security than others do? || i enjoy posting this... heres what youll get with this question 45 fortinet! its great, great priceforperformance, and they work! 45 pan its the best, everyone else sucks. the cost is worth it! 4 anything but cisco, they are awful. 4 no, no. cisco is figuring it out. fp is pretty good now.. and its cisco. 2 everything else. checkpoint, pfsense, sonicwall, whatever. || my palo knowledge has gotten me much farther in my career than my cisco, checkpoint, or sophos abilities. || windows firewall because no one knows it exists and always blames the hardware firewall."

AI in network maintenance,"had a 7 year stint at a very prominent infosec company but was looking into next steps, got laid off before i even knew it along with every other seniorish position on my team. just pondering good movement here as i was moving into more network admin roles before the harsh cut. was heavily involved in jira until i realized ai involvement was sweeping in. || ai is sweeping in everywhere but its kinda shit at nearly everything it does. not sure what your question is but next step is generally finding a role that pays the bills. if youre sticking with networking i would strongly advise picking up ansible and python skills and from there docker and maybe db django. nautobot netbox and api. if you are staying in infosec id leverage your relationships youve made over the years as networking with humans is still a great way to get work. || if you caught an ax with the seniors, it wasnt because you werent delivering, it was a cost savings play. so youre good to keep doing you just find a new place to do it. || sorry to hear but it time to reach out to contacts. if you attended conferences blackhat, defcon, bsides, local hacker spaces and made connections its time to leverage them. been in the field for 30 years, back to the day when packet filtering was state of the firewalling. these days its about coding skills along with other funtionmentials. its a close nit community, especially for us old timers, but someone knows of someone that looking for a skilled person, having the connections with people that you trust and trust you is key to landing a new position quickly! its not a profession for the weak, the thing i like about the field its ever changing downfall is it takes efforts to keep evolving yourself."
AI in network maintenance,"hello folks, i moved from a senior desktop consultant to a network engineer in the span of about six years. i gravitated to networking because it was a challenging and rewarding job at times. something i really didnt get with systems or infrastructure work. now im in a cisco centric environment, working in the mist of cisco cli and meraki devices. feeling plateaued and like i need to upskill. currently a ccna but i was wondering, with ai, automation and machine learning and different buzz words humming around networking what are you guys and gals learninggetting certified in to modernize your skill set with the fast changing itnetworking landscape? cheers! || learn automation and programming. cisco devnet associates blueprint is a good starting point. || rather than asking what we think, ask yourself where you want you career to go. what interests you? unless you do something that you like youll end up being a network zombie that rambles on about imposter syndrome and network automation. is networking really fast changing? automation has been around long enough to be of legal drinking age in many counties, next gen firewalls are more than a decade old as are sdn platforms like cisco aci. aws will be 20 next year || currently a ccna get ccnp"
AI in network maintenance,"so im currently a network admin in the airforce and im wanting to use my airforce experience and free education to get a good tech job on the outside. when i look at job postings i see that they ask for a lot of coding experience. ive even seen postings for software engineers. my question is what should i focus on, what languages, what skills are needed to get to this point! ive used ai to create a career path but im interested in what you all have to say || it really depends on what you want to do. do you want to build web apps? mobile apps? or perhaps do data science, data engineering, or integration related work? || hey im a network admin in the air force too. python and vs code are in the apl. approved products list you can start using it to script out vlan changes or stigs to begin || python is a good one. a lot of network automation vids ive seen use it. once you learn one the next one wont be too hard since they all function in similar fashion."
AI in network maintenance,"straight up. i understand the business efficiency gains from having one person able to administer thousands of devices, but there has to be a point of detrimental or limited returns, having that much knowledge in one persons head. theres a reason i went into technical maintenance instead of software development though, i just do not like writing out code. its not fun. its not engaging. its boring, rigid and thoughtless. every job posting i see requires beyond the basic scripting requirements, wanting python, cc or some kind of webbased software development framework like node, javascript or worse. everything has to be automated, you have to know version control, git, cicd pipelines to a virtualized lab in the cloud and dont forget to be a cloud engineer too. where does it end? at what point are the fundamental networks of the world going to run so poorly because nobody understands the actual networking aspect of the systems, theyre just good software engineers? is it really in the best interest of the business to have indeterminable network crashes because the knowledge of being a network engineer is gone? or maybe this is just me falling into the late 30s i dont want to learn anything anymore slump. i dont think it is, im just not interested in being a code monkey. || knowing the basics of a scripting language like python or powershell doesnt mean youre a software engineer. i run the infrastructure group where i work and i wouldnt hire someone without basic scripting ability, this is 2025 not 2005. you dont have to build an automation system from scratch but you also shouldnt waste hours on a task that a handful of lines of python could do instead. i see this on the windows side of the house as well. so many people that were button clickers from the 2000s that refused to learn anything command line now wonder why theyre not getting promotions or turned down for interviews. your switches run linux bruv, learn the tools. || you think the i dont want to learn new things slump is bad in your 30s? add a couple decades onto that. glad i was able to retire last year at 60. now i can learn fun stuff without cluttering my brain with junk. i still have nortel meridian commands floating around up there lol. or atm commands for marconi switches. || voice engineers didnt want to learn networking either but voip happened. adapt or retire."
