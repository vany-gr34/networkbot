WHITE PAPER DATA CENTERS: BEST PRACTICES FOR SECURITY AND PERFORMANCE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Network service providers seeking Cisco ® Powered Network Program membership must meet rigor ous application requirements that, among other things, include netw ork performance, network security, and customer sup port. Designation also requires an annual program complia nce review that guides the Cisco Powered Network Pr ogram member toward best practices in the area of overall network design and operations. In the course of wo rking with service providers around the world on these technical revie ws, Cisco has developed a criteria and checklists t o determine program eligibility. This Data Center White Paper i s useful to those constructing or managing data cen ters with stringent performance and service requirements. Enterprise an d commercial customers seeking to purchase Web host ing, applications hosting, call and contact management, or content delivery-type services may also find thi s guide helpful in evaluating a service provider’s data centers. DATA CENTER DESIGN OBJECTIVES There are four objectives in the design of any high performance data center: Security, availability, s calability, and manageability. Today’s business and competitive environment requir es that each of these objectives be considered from a complete end-to-end perspective. Clients or users connecting to the data center meas ure performance by timely access to the desired app lication data, whether the connection is point to point or via an Internet connection. The u ser must perceive reasonable response and connectio n time. Access is no longer measured solely on an arbitrary measure of “network availabi lity” or ping times. This fact does not lesson the goal of developing networks that provide 99.999 percent availability. However, the implicati on is that the designers of the traditional network ing elements must also become “contentaware.” Security Security can no longer be treated as an afterthough t when it comes to optimum network design. Trial-an d-error networking is not an option, as a single vulnerability could compromise the corporate lifeblood, the network. In such a high-stakes envi ronment, only specialized expertise is acceptable. There are challenges in offering encryp tion, certification, directory, network, and other security components that enable what one would consider a 100 percent secure network. While industry struggles with developing the technology t o provide these protective components, the IT manager must still cope on a daily basis to reduce the network’s imminent risk. A complete network security solution includes authe ntication, authorization, data privacy, and perimet er security. Perimeter security is traditionally provided by a firewall, which inspect s packets and sessions to determine if they should be transmitted or dropped. In effect, firewalls have become a single point of network acc ess where traffic can be analyzed and controlled ac cording to parameters such as application, address, and user for both incoming tr affic from remote users, and outgoing traffic to th e Internet. In general, firewalls are intended to protect resou rces from several kinds of attacks such as passive eavesdropping/packet sniffing, IP address spoofing, port scans, denial-of-service (DoS) attac ks such as SYNchronize-ACKnowledge attack (SYN floo ding), packet injection, and application-layer attack.

See the data center best practices checklist (Appen dix A). The checklist begins with the physical secu rity of the data center and its environment (electric power, temperature, and humidity controls ). The checklist also contains recommendations conc erning network security in general terms, recognizing that threats may occur actively or passively (sometimes called opportunistically), and from people and events either outside or inside the data center itself. Connectivity path s to external networks, and each function inside th e data center (such as gateway or WAN edge, core, distribution, and access), must be designed w ith no single point of entry for unauthorized users. Availability Availability is generally ensured by the overall ne twork design and implemented in several ways. First, networks are designed with steps to minimize the occurrence of service problems and the time to recover from problems (such as backup reco very policies). Second, high availability must be considered at each layer of th e Open Systems interconnection (OSI) reference mode l, with redundancy and failover provisions made at the physical, data link (for exa mple, Ethernet), network (for example, IP), and app lication layers. The most effective solutions are those with consistent engineering con siderations tightly integrated throughout the data center, rather than those approached with a series of “point-solution” products and techniques. Scalability Scalability must be provided in every data center. Server load balancing is the norm, and techniques s uch as reverse proxy caching are often used to offload servers. Server load balancing, lik e other aspects of data center design, must also be content-aware, preferably using delayed binding, full URL and cookie inspection, and “stick y (server) connections” as part of the logic of cho osing a server for each user request. Specific content may be in high demand and consider ed “hot.” Because this content may not be known in advance (such as breaking news stories), advanced data centers should also have th e ability to automatically and immediately identify and replicate hot content to overflow or backup servers or cache to ensure the ability to su pport the increased demand without compromising per formance. Both the complications and available solutions incr ease greatly if the data center is part of a geogra phically dispersed set. The ability to provide content at multiple sites allows the served data to be “closer” to the requesting client, thus providi ng faster response but also higher availability (due to partial or complete redundancy of the data). But multidata center design must then include con siderations of management of the data content, distribution of updates, synchronization o f different sources, proper routing of requests, ha ndling of downed servers, additional security and so on. Manageability Manageability means much more than simply knowing i f a server or other network element is “up or down. ” Especially in service provider data centers supporting multiple customers, the ability to assess service levels on a per-customer basis is essential to the offering and administration of service-level agreements (SLAs). Managing IP add ress assignments, keeping track of network configur ations, and not losing site of trouble tickets and alarms often requires use of a mechaniz ed network operations center (NOC) support system. Good manageability tools and qualified personnel supporting the infrastructure translate i nto lower operations costs, since time is not waste d trying to resolve indications from conflicting management systems and higher customer satisfaction.
