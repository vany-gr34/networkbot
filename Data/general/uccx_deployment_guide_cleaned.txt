22IntroductionFebruary 2013 SeriesIntroductionBusiness OverviewThe ability to easily add functionality into the telephony environment for corporate help desks has been challenging. Organizations use help desks in their Human Resources departments to answer personnel questions, in IT departments to help employees with their computer problems, and in their facilities departments to maintain and manage their buildings. A help desk minimizes the time it takes to answer employees’ questions and maximizes the available internal resources.Traditional contact center solutions are difficult to implement because of the additional hardware components and the complexity of the software needed to implement them. The work is normally done by highly trained engineers who spend the majority of their time working with contact centers. The complexity makes the implementation a long process and the additional expertise makes the installation and maintenance expensive. Agents are required to work at the location of the contact center equipment because the inherent limitations of the hardware prevent them from working remotely. It is very difficult to integrate the overall system with the corporate data because common interfaces are not readily available.Technical Overview The next-generation IP help desk takes advantage of a company’s internal network by making use of the IP private branch exchange (PBX) and other IP-based applications to create a better experience for the callers. Calls are routed to available agents who have the expertise to answer the ques-tions, regardless of their physical location in the company. Agents can view information about the caller through integration with corporate databases; and historical data is saved and viewed in easily readable reports that help improve the day-to-day workings of the help desk. These are just a few of the benefits offered by a fully integrated IP help desk.Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX) is the IP-based help desk solution offered by Cisco Systems. It is tightly integrated with other Cisco Unified Communications platforms. Design and testing is performed on the suite of Unified Communications products as part of a complete solu-tion. Configuration of Unified CCX is easier than traditional systems because the components talk to each other over the internal IP network, which helps streamline the procedures. For example, when a phone number is created on Unified CCX to reach a help desk application, no additional configuration is needed in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM). The configuration is sent over the network to Unified CM and the directory number is created. Unified CM is automatically configured to pass calls for the directory number to Unified CCX for further processing.When a call is placed to the help desk, it is first processed by Cisco Unified CM, which recognizes that the number is destined for the Cisco Unified CCX application server. Unified CCX receives the incoming call and identi-fies which application script is needed to handle the request based on the extension number that was dialed. The script plays prompts and collects digits as dictated by the steps in the script and, if necessary, uses the infor-mation from the caller to select an appropriate agent. If an appropriate agent is not available, the call is put in queue and music is streamed to the caller. As soon as an agent is available, Unified CCX instructs Unified CM to ring the agent’s phone. When the agent picks up, information about the caller is populated into the agent’s desktop application and the conversation begins.Cisco Unified CCX has the features of a large contact center packaged into a singleor dual-server deployment. The system scales up to 400 concurrent agents, 42 supervisors, 150 agent groups, and 150 skill groups. It includes email, outbound calling, inbound calling, workforce optimization, and reporting.

4IntroductionFebruary 2013 Series4The Cisco Unified CCX features are listed in more detail below:f$XWRPDWLFFDOOGLVWULEXWRU $&' —Unified CCX routes calls by using skills or resource groups. Skills-based routing distributes the call based on the skill level of the agent for a particular topic. It is the method most often used. Resource-group routing distributes calls to agents based on the resource group to which the agents are assigned. f,QWHUDFWLYHYRLFHUHVSRQVH ,95 —IVR controls the interaction between the caller, prompts, and menus. Depending on the options the caller enters into the system, IVR uses an application script to determine how to handle the call. IVR can read or write corporate database information, play information such as tracking numbers to callers, and collect infor-mation from the caller through digits or speech recognition. f$JHQW(PDLO—Agent Email allows customers to contact the help desk by email. Agents are assigned skills, and email is distributed to agents based on their skills. Email agents can use preset templates in their replies to avoid writing repetitive emails.f$JHQW'HVNWRS—Cisco Agent Desktop is an application that resides on the agent’s computer. Agents use the application to log in at the begin-ning of their shifts, indicate whether they are in a ready state or on a break, and log out at the end of the day. When an agent is logged in and ready, calls are sent to Agent Desktop, which presents information about the incoming call. The application has an integrated browser to access a customer database or browse the Internet to help answer a question. Agent Desktop is a great tool for agents because everything they need to do their job is in one place, which allows them to focus on answering the caller’s question. f6XSHUYLVRU'HVNWRS—Cisco Supervisor Desktop helps supervisors keep track of real-time statistics such as how many calls are in queue, the number of agents available, and the average time a caller is spend-ing in queue. Supervisors can also use Supervisor Desktop to coach agents by silently monitoring calls, chatting with agents, joining a call, and pushing a webpage down to an Agent Desktop. Supervisor Desktop helps supervisors ensure that calls are being handled on a timely basis and agents are not giving callers incorrect information. If there is an issue, Supervisor Desktop allows them to quickly address the problem.f5HSRUWLQJ—Cisco Unified CCX saves statistics in an internal database that can be accessed by the historical reporting client application to cre-ate reports. Reports can be scheduled on a recurring basis or created as needed. Reports can be general, such as information about the entire help desk over a year, or specific, such as information about a particular agent for one day. Historical reports allow managers to get a big picture of their help desk and to make changes to address issues.f:RUNIRUFH0DQDJHPHQW—Workforce Management is a tool that uses a sophisticated algorithm to look through historical data and create a schedule that will have the right number of agents on staff at the right times during the day. This tool helps ensure that more agents are on staff at busy times and agents have scheduled breaks during slow times.f4XDOLW\0DQDJHU—Quality Manager is a tool that records calls. Quality Manager randomly selects calls throughout the day to be recorded, or you can select specific calls to record. This tool also creates standard-ized score sheets to help determine how well the agent handled the call. Quality Manager is a great coaching tool designed to make the help-desk experience more satisfying for the caller.Cisco Unified CCX is a powerful application. Through its strong scripting engine, easy-to-use desktops, extensive reporting tools, and sophisticated workforce optimization, it can successfully operate even the most compli-cated corporate help desks. The next several sections of this document will guide you through the process of installing and configuring Cisco Unified CCX in a Unified CM environment.
5Deployment DetailsFebruary 2013 Series5Deployment DetailsCisco Unified CCX runs on the same Linux operating systems as several other Unified Communications platforms from Cisco. You install the operat-ing system with the application by using the standard installation DVD. Preparing the Platform for Unified CCX1. Configure platform connectivity to the LAN2. Prepare the server for Unified CCXProcess For a quick and easy installation experience, it is essential to know up front what information you will need. For Cisco Unified CCX, make sure you have completed the following steps before you start:fIf you are installing Cisco Unified CCX on a new virtual machine (VM), download the Open Virtualization Archive (OVA) file from the Cisco website: http://software.cisco.com/download/release.html?mdfid=284666782&flowid=38602&softwareid=283733053&release=2.3&relind=AVAILABLE&rellifecycle=&reltype=latestfDetermine if there is a patch for your version of Cisco Unified CCX by checking the Cisco website: http://software.cisco.com/download/release.html?mdfid=284666782&flowid=38602&softwareid=280840578&release=9.0(2)&relind=AVAILABLE&rellifecycle=&reltype=latestProcedure 1 Conﬁgure platform connectivity to the LANThe Cisco Unified Contact Center Express server can be connected to a Cisco Nexus switch in the data center or a Cisco Catalyst switch in the server room. In both cases, QoS policies are added to the ports to maintain voice quality during the setup and completion of calls. Please choose the option that is appropriate for your environment.Option 1. Connect Cisco Uniﬁed CCX to a Nexus 2248UPStep 1: Login to the Nexus switch with a username that has the ability to make configuration changes. Step 2: If there is a previous configuration on the switch port where the Unified CCX is connected, remove the individual commands by issuing a no in front of each one to bring the port back to its default state.Step 3: Configure the port as an access port and apply the QoS policy.interface Ethernet107/1/18 description Unified Contact Center Express switchport access vlan 148 spanning-tree port type edge service-policy type qos input DC-FCOE+1P4Q_INTERFACE-DSCP-QOSWhen deploying a dual-homed Cisco Nexus 2248, you must apply this configuration to both Nexus 5548s.Tech Tip
6Deployment DetailsFebruary 2013 Series6Option 2. Connect Cisco Uniﬁed CCX to a Catalyst 3750-XTo ensure that signaling traffic is prioritized appropriately, you must con-figure the Cisco Catalyst access switch port where Cisco Unified CCX is connected to trust the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) markings. The easiest way to do this is to clear the interface of any previous configura-tion and then apply the egress QoS macro that was defined in the access-switch platform configuration of the Cisco SBA—Borderless Networks LAN Deployment Guide. Step 1: Login to the Catalyst switch with a username that has the privileges to make configuration changes. Step 2: Clear the interface’s configuration on the switch port where the Unified CCX is connected.default interface GigabitEthernet1/0/18Step 3: Configure the port as an access port and apply the Egress QoS policy. interface GigabitEthernet1/0/18 description Unified Contact Center Express switchport access vlan 148 switchport host macro apply EgressQoSProcedure 2 Prepare the server for Uniﬁed CCXYou must choose one of the following options, depending upon how you plan to deploy the server:fIf you are installing a virtual machine, follow the steps in Option 1, “Prepare a virtual machine for Cisco Unified CCX.”fIf you are installing a standalone server, locate the Cisco Unified CCX DVD that shipped with your order, and then follow the steps in Option 2 “Prepare a server for Cisco Unified CCX”.The following tables describe the scaling options for Cisco Unified CCX: Table 1 - Cisco Unified CCX virtual machine scaling options100 agents300 agents400 agentsVirtual CPUs224CPU speed900 MHz900 MHz900 MHzRAM448Hard disk146 GB (1)146 GB (2)146 GB (2)VMware ESXi4.0, 4.1, 5.04.0, 4.1, 5.04.0, 4.1, 5.0OS supportRHE Linux 5 (32-bit)RHE Linux 5 (32-bit)RHE Linux 5 (32-bit)Total agents100 or fewer100 to 300300 to 400Table 2 - Cisco Unified CCX standalone server scaling options100 agents400 agentsCisco MCS equivalent78357845CPU TypeE5504 quad-coreE5540 quad-coreCPU speed2.0 GHz2.53 GHzRAM46Hard disk300 GB (2)300 GB (4)OS supportRHE Linux 5 (32-bit)RHE Linux 5 (32-bit)Total agents100 or fewer100 to 400Option 1.
