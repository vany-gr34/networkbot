prometheus network monitoring,"hey all, just thinking about setting up some network monitoring and id like to monitor intrazone traffic within an esxi environment. after some research, it looks like promiscuous mode on a port group is viable however, it would only capture broadcast, multicast and the traffic hitting the physical nics. as far as i know, this wouldnt capture any unicast traffic between vms in the same port group for example. have any of ye gone down this route with standard v switches or is the req. simply distrubuted switches? || "
prometheus network monitoring,"hi! with a dropbox and a script like nacbypass from scipag it is possible to bypass 802.1x. so the dropbox sits in the middle of an authenticated device and the 802.1x network port. general question can such a bypass in general be prevented? are there additional hardening measures that can make the exploitation harder? if it cannot be prevented, can it be detected through monitoring? thanks || 1 physical security is always paramount 2 having additional layers in place i.e. following the zero trust model in assuming the network is hostile || this why tls must be used || my opinion which people seem to hate here is treat every network like a coffee shop... all users must vpn, no network is special. everything else is a massive waste of time and effort. || so this seems conceptually similar to what p0ny plug did years ago and yes these types of infiltrations are hard to spot unless you are looking at flow data and see the unusual ports coming from the attacking client or your daclsgaclrole for the legitimate connected client is restrictive enough to contain the potential ports being used by the attacker device. in general, many shops have trouble with pc type client controls since people do different to things on different days and its hard to account for variance. big hvd shops solve this by saying hvd is the legitimate destination and then use software controls on the hvd for additional protection of legitimate traffic. the attacker might still have a window into the underlay though and its a difficult thing to solve at scale in a large enterprise. welcome to the rationale of defenseexpense in depth and zero trust to help place protection on critical data and start assuming the internal networks are always in some level of potential compromise. || this can be a tough one to defend against. one option is to have all the clients you manage use ipsec to communicate. definitely a time investment to get that all setup and configured though. || you could enable macsec on the access ports to encrypt traffic between the switch and the computer. however i dont see this use case often as switches having macsec on access port may cost much more and you need to manage end to end the encryption key with computers. could you monitor that ? most of the time, those equipment are hardened to not do any noise in the network, difficult to see on profiling part or even to block multiple mac address per port as they just spoof the one from the end device. an idea would be to introduce intelligent ndr, so you monitor traffic and when something deviate from your baseline, you can generate an alert and start investigating on this behavior. || yes. by using mac auth instead of port auth. althought i suppose its still possible to spoof the mac by the intermediate device. makes it harder though"
prometheus network monitoring,"from what ive seen so far, most switches have 4 possible span sessions per switch. so you usually group your connections to the switch into vlans or just pass through say 8 ports to a single span session. problem is, as everyone knows, span sessions can miss packets if you push the ports youre monitoring hard enough. given that the span port is 1gbps and each of the monitored ports is also 1gbps, its easy to see that it doesnt take much to push things for packets to start getting dropped when you even have just two links per span session. so i was thinking, why not simply use 2 twisted pair ethernet cables an 4 twisted pairs for the span links? in other words, when making your ethernet cables, simply only use 2 twisted pairs rather than 4. this will force network speeds of that link to 100mbps. for low bandwidth applications, this should still be more than enough speed and this way, you can have 5 ethernet links per span session without overwhelming your 1gbps span link. what do you guys think? || you can configure port speeds to lower rates without having to pull pairs out of cables but less and less gear even supports 100mbps. crippling your production network just to meet span port restrictions seems bonkers and speeds are only ever going up. the correct answer is taps and packet brokers. || thats exactly what scotts throwing star does. plus you can tap right in, without a span. but in todays world, where would a 100mbit tap be even remotely useful? were in need of 100 and 400gbit taps, not 100mbit. || isnt this where taps would be used? || as others have said, you can just set an interface to negotiate for a lower speed. but then youre going to limit your hosts to 100 megabit. this adds latency takes 10 times as long to send a frame and if you get to over 100 megabit, youre going to drop packets. span would see all the packets, but youd have packet drops for your app. || technically, ethernet only uses two pairs anyway, so buggering a cable in hopes that it might cause your autonegotiation to fail is not a very reliable strategy. at that point you cant be sure it will negotiate 100. it might still negotiate 1000, and just drop packets like mad or not. if you need to monitor 1g data aggregate, use a faster port. there are 2.5g and 5g ports, but 10g is probably just as easy. the cisco 9300 can support up to 66 sessions with rspan destinations. if you need to manage the bandwidth, qos policy is probably the better answer."
prometheus network monitoring,"i have a customer who we did a network design for just over a year ago. we talked them through all the pros and cons as part of the design process and they selected to terminate all the vlans onto their cisco switches and then just have a layer 3 transit up to the firewall. this firewall was easy to spec as it was essentially just a case of how big are your internet pipes, how much might they grow over the next 56 years. boom there is a firewall. we are now 12 months layer and they are saying we want to terminate all the vlans and they have a lot, and want more onto the firewall. i agree this is a superior and potentially more secure design but i suspect if we do this it will just overload the firewall as it just wasnt speced for that use case. the customer, and rightfully so, is saying give us some figures to backup that statement. that got me thinking.... what is the best way to do this? my initial thought process is put netflow in on the core switch and look at the traffic levels between the various vlans. we could also monitor the traffic levels on the svis its a cisco core switch and see what traffic levels they get. currently the customer is using prtg but is there some other tools that could give us better reporting? but what does reddit think? what have i missed? what else could i consider? ||  || you dont say anything about the fw capabilities. its very difficult to answer the question in the title if you dont specify the firewall itself. and i do agree with other comments it all depends what you want to do with the traffic when it hits the firewall. do you just want to do regular l4 filtering or are they going with something like l7 filtering appid with pa, ssl decryption? are you going to employ security profiles to filter ew traffic as well? is the firewall doing any ipsec tunneling or ravpn? basically, its not just the amount of traffic, its also what youre going to do with it. newer fortigates and pa series starting with 400 series are small beasts and can handle a lot of abuse of course, the more you need, the higher you go on the ladder when speccing the fw as well. as for routing, i disagree with some of the comments unless youre talking about very specific routing usually reserved for datacenters, firewalls are more than capable of doing it, at least major vendors in the field are. if youre talking about just intervlan routing, then double that. ive been in networking field for past 20 years, last 10 years mostly security engineering firewalls and unless im working with a very specific type of a company that absolutely needs to have line speed for intervlan traffic, all vlans are terminated on the firewall, no exception im done with the days of 2010 years ago when i was trying to figure out which acl on a switch is blocking something. || group networks inside a vrf and use the firewall as the gateway. this reduces the number of vlans on the firewall and allows east west between like networks with minimal security concern. || we eliminated vrfs to the firewall and now terminated specific vlan types on the firewall. however, sizing is difficult. netflow would be an indicator to help size, but without knowing the infa, i cannot give you a suggestion on how to size. || so the firewall is specd for north south traffic but youre now introducing eastwest. work out how much traffic in total goes across the svis and then subtract the traffic of the sviinterface that goes into the fw from said total. thats how much extra traffic the fw will have to deal with. || do they do a lot of east west traffic? is it a reasonable amount of vlans? what do the firewall specs say about it? ive spent almost my whole career in high security enterprise networks and in all but high performance data center environments we have done firewall as the gateway. it works fine, except when it doesnt. normally related to security rules and apps doing non standard stuff. if you need east west security who doesnt now anymore firewall as gateway is good, if you spec it correctly. if your firewall is undersized you will have a bad time. if you are bad at setting up and making security rules, you will have a bad time, or you will open it up so wide you might as well have not even done it. || a good general security rule is administrative simplicity attack surface consolidation do they have redundant firewalls? single point of failure? if a patch or update shuts the firewall down is the business dead externally internally or both? perform a risk assessment on firewall failure and time to restore. additionally theyre planning on growing. additionally the hardware for core switches is designed for that purpose, firewalls general lg have beefier cpus for decision making. switches dont choose they just do never wanna make the firewall confused. dxb || graph the bw they are using for intervlan routing and then add that to the traffic already on the firewall. also keep in mind any arpsession limits of the fw. || perform erspan or rspan depending on your cabling and or broker capacity. you can use neflow as well but think about sampling of the switch. and for sure depends on the number of vlansswitch capacity. last comment, performing terminaison on firewall can be a bad idea if you have dizains of vlans,over dizains of access switches, because of bum traffic. and to think about upgradefailover as well spof. || we do this in certain networks where every vlan needs a different firewall policy. i think we have maybe a dozen or so networks that route directly up to the firewall and as a result the firewall has 13 or so interfaces. we run a custom linux vm as the firewall running iptables and it seems to be fine. other networks we operate use three or so little 28 transit networks to peer down to the core switches and then the core switches have vrfs that group endpoint networks together and then route northbound to the firewall to access the rest of the network. again, iptables running on linux. its all about how granular your security policy is but modern firewalls should be up to the task either way. || it depends on the performance requirements and budget. if you need like 500gbps of throughout, you will have to shell out a small fortune, but fortigates can do a couple of tbps so this is all doable. vlans dont really matter, it can do all the 4000 or whatever the limit is for them. if its something small then definitely you shouldnt worry about it. || the major benefit of having a firewall as the routing point means that you can inspect client to server flows. so the main question here is what type of inspection are you going to perform? if you intent on inspecting encrypted flows estimate your best case performance metrics with the full security control for 1. bandwidth 2. concurrent connections 3. connections per second after that you need to enable netsflow and get the respective numbers and protocols of at least a couple of weeks telemetry. you need to identify 1. per vlan interface ingress traffic and then add of the vlans bandwidth, that would be your firewall throughput 2. per vlan tcp syn packets per second sflow is a better telemetry for this and then add this for all vlans, this will be your connections per second. 3. per vlan established connections netfow is a better telemetry for this and then add for all vlans to get your concurrent connections. from the netsflow check the protocols used and see what inspection capabilities does the firewall offer. if for example you have sctp traffic and your firewall does not inspect it, then why firewall it since a simple acl has the same effect. || define a lot. we terminate all of ours on fws. || firewalls by natures are not great routers. they certainly can route but they are not great routers. i would only terminate vlans on the firewall that have traffic that need to be filtered going in or out of the vlan. i would leave the routing to routers that are up or down stream of the firewall. || imo you need to take a look at the expected memory impact of a large mac arp table on your chosen firewall. check the max values table for that model and go from there. there will also be added memory and cpu hits for all the broadcast and dhcp traffic. youre concentrating this load onto the firewall instead of distributing across switchesl3 routers."
prometheus network monitoring,"hey all, i dont have a plethora of experience in specifics in networking. ive used and set up vlans, nats, and subnets multiple times. i work in the industrial automatic space for an oem that makes packaging equipment. our customers are often bigger companies that have their own specifications for networking. generally it makes sense and aligns with my understanding of networking hierarchy and security. but we have one customer who requires us to use managed switches, and will dictate to us which ip addresses we can use and often get down to the specifics of which deviceip is connected to which port on the switch. they require us to ship them the switch were using so they can provision and configure it, then they ship it back. all of that is fine, and makes sense. the confusing part for me is that in their specifications documentation, it specifies that a nat cannot be used anywhere in the system. what inevitably happens is the systems principal controller plc first port is on a specified subnet with the rest of the equipmentdevices. the controllers second port is configured to a different subnet, which then connects to the customers intranet through the managed switch to be monitored and maintained. i recently asked the person who essentially leads all automation equipment purchasing for that customer, and i asked if he knew why the company has a firm requirement of not using a nat. he just said, ohhh, no no no. nats are a big nono. since then, ive been reading and i, for the life of me, cannot understand why this could be. but i also admit i dont know enough to know where to look. in my mind, the way the second port is configured and then connected through the switch mimics the actions of a nat. can someone explain how im a silly goose thats overlooking something? thanks in advance! || ot equipment and their vendors are notoriously bad at anything security related. especially the vpn devices the vendors love to try to sneak on to the network to have remote access to their stuff. there is no need for nat if i give you the address space to use and a gateway to route traffic to. also, when i have to yank that vpn device out because the vendor has been hacked again i can easily replace it with my own. ifwhen we want to expand or connect or add additional automation or collect data i can do that with out having to rely on you to come back and readdress the equipment so that its routable on my network. ive seen ot equipment using insane subnets that are routable over the public internet. no your plc cannot have an address of 1.1.1.1 or 1.2.3.4 and no your hmi cannot be 8.8.8.8 or any other random address ive seen outside of rfc1918. long story short, its our network, if your equipment cant handle different ip addresses from whatever you think it should be, it is not welcome in our environment. that being said i bend over backwards to get ot vendors to see the light and do things the right way. || nat sometimes breaks applications. || for mei can see a couple reasons. one is to make sure devices stay physically isolated. no gateway to the outside world. only the plc and its endpoints. i also know plcs and vfds can be harsh on a network and having nat manage that net can cause issues with its broadcast multicast storms. and it may be a security red safety system policy that isolated networks are in place with no possible way to interfere with the safety control endpoints. the absence of nat also means no openvpn, openssl, wireguard, ipsec etc. can possibly gain access. || if i had to take a guess, its because the natd subnet wouldnt be advertised through their routing protocol, and thus unroutable. i cant think of any reason you would want to use a nat. but i also cant think of a security concern that it would create. so my conclusion is its a routing issue. || sounds like its a closed network. as nat is used to translate internal ip to external ip. so assuming no nat this is an environment thats specifically locked down. so dod, ot, or high security environment. this is common in these environments. as nat is done at the routerfirewall level. so they most likely have separate isp line for external communication and an internal network that is not connected to route to isp gateway next hop. || is there a certain nat operation that they dont want to have done? for example dnat from wan? that would make sense. other than that, as a network technican im a bit stumbled by that. we supply ipsec routers for a machine manufacturer which sell their machines globally and every router performs various nat operations 11nat, snat. it has never been a problem, why would it? it happens in our part of the network. but i would restrain on requering the customers to create nat rules on their routing equipment. we just need a list of permitted outgoing ports ntp, dns, ipsec"
prometheus network monitoring,"i currently work as a net admin for a large health care organization, 4 years experience. i am paid 72kyr no benefits but good teammates and manager, get to touch a lot and learn a lot palo alto firewall, nac, routeswitch, sdwan, solarwinds, linux servers, certificates, active directory, data center, cloud, voip, etc. got an offer for a network engineer role at a large f500 company. after the interview i learned that this network team doesnt touch firewall, nac, monitoring, servers, ad etc, its purely onsite traditional routeswitchwireless. the pay is 95k100k with full benefits. wondering what i should value more at this point in my career. if i stay at the current organization i will learn a lot more, have the chance to work my way up to engineer within the next 23 years with a good team i trust. on the other hand if i jump ship to the new f500, i would have a very prestigious title at a very prestigious company and make a ton more money. my only concern is im afraid i may be siloed into traditional networking when ive been trying to inch my way more into cloud, and network security. what would you do? what is more valuable? money or experience? edit i also want to mention job stability because thats important in this economy. the current organization is recession proof in a way, i have full job security here, never any layoffs in 80 years, whereas the f500 is in an economy dependent industry that is known for mass layoffs. should this should be taken into consideration due to the current state of the economy? || why would you wait 23 years for a title bump to network engineer when youre already doing network engineer things. if you are making changes to firewalls andor switches then youre already a network engineer. shouldnt even been thinking about this, take the new job and work on some cloud certs and use it as leverage for an even higher paying cloud architect job in the future. edit if you really like your current job and team ask them to match the offer benefits title now. || in a perfect world youd get it all, right? but i can say i notice the benefits of money everyday, and of experience once in awhile. || make the switch and take the money. keep learning and building your skill set. once you feel things are stagnating then make another switch. education is important but youre working for money. || i cant answer this question for you but ill give you a perspective. you already have experience with firewalls, linux and a host of other stuff that the new team doesnt touch. this makes you more valuable in my eyes as you should be able to identify and resolve issues quicker or more effectively cause you have seen the other side dont blame the network essentially. another thing to consider is you say you can reach l23 level which may provide more monetary benefit lets say 4 years down the line. if you make the switch today, thats a potential extra 250k over 10 years. in 10 years time, will the extra payment from a promotion 4 years down the line, offset the 250k, and if so by how much? || 72kyr sounds low depending on locationcost of living i dont know how much value the benefits give, but it sounds like the f500 company is the right move if you want to hone in on those skills. theres nothing wrong with being a jack of all trades master of none either. || the f500 pays you more, gives you less responsibility, provides more upwardlateral mobility, and offers a much better opportunity to pivot into another large company if you decide its not for you. you can learn all the fancy useless tech which may never be used at work at home and pad your resume however you want once your foot is in the door. || leave in a heartbeat for benefits. who cares on what technology you get touch. get a title and pay bump is worth it. || id go based on the benefits alone. || i cannot give you the answer but i am wondering the same thing, the technologies you described are almost exactly what i use in my current rolemoving more and more towards azure, but always wondered if i should make a move towards classical networking in an isp or something. very interested what the answers will be here. || genuine question not trying to be an asshole, but what do you mean by no benefits? do you mean like...no bonus? bad pto? or do you mean like...no insurance? || take it! youre new and need more ink on the resume, plus you get a very nice pay increase and a f500 name on the resume as well. congrats! || first thing i would say is that no job is going to keep you from working on what you want to work on...or learn what you want to learn. that said, dont get nostalgic or fall in love with any jobcompany. put yourself in the best position for your current needs. with your current job, you say you touch all these different technologies. are you an expert level engineer on them? does your access permit you to become an expert on them if youre not? for the new job, being a network engineer usually includes networking in the cloud and network security tasks. out of all the things you were mentioning, routing and switching is a great thing to be an expert on. ive interviewed probably 20 different network engineers in the past 5 years and none of them really knew routing and switching like you would want them to. experience is great when it is actually hands on and in depth, not just gui based or skimming the surface. i would make the move. thats my advice i guess. ive been doing this since the 1990s for reference. || i took a 25,000 a year pay cut moving from a public safety communications vendor to a local county. my title went from engineer to manager. my medical is fully covered by the county, i have a county vehicle that i take home, county matches retirement 21 so i put in 7 every match and double. my wife works for the hospital system, all the kids are on her insurance cheaper than putting them on mine. benefits sold the job. || it sounds like youre being taken advantage of right now. without benefits, hows your retirement accounts looking? how long do you have to retirement? i would not like to be the new guy the way the economy has been running the last few weeks, but if you take the extra money you would earn at the new place and put it away, youll be banking one month worth of emergency funds every three calendar months. and thats a pretty good risk offset. || dude, take the higher paying job at a bigger company with benefits. this is not even a question"
prometheus network monitoring,"hello fellow networking folks, im currently trying to build a small monitoring solution for multicasts. in our lab we have a nexus9000 c93108tcex running version 7.0. i want to start with this device and maybe later continue supporting others. the goal is to see for each interface which multicasts are entering and which are leaving. sflow seems to be a viable solution for this problem since it just samples a defined subset of all the packets passing through the monitored interfaces. for each sampled packets sflow provides some additional information. for me the source id index and the input interface value are most interesting. i am keeping to the field descriptions provided by wireshark since different sources call them differently. when a packets arrives from outside the switch on one monitored interface, everything works flawlessly. i can compare the two values to the values in the mibii interface description. both values match as they should. when a packets is leaving the switch the story goes differently. the input interface value is correct so i can still see, on which physical interface a packet entered the switch. source id index always displays hex 0x80000000. it should show the interface i am monitoring right now, the interface from wich the packet was sampled. if the situation stays like that i can only properly monitor incoming multicasts but i cannot monitor through which interfaces packets leave the switch. in my opinion the cisco documentation is not really clear if this behavior is expected or not. for nxos 10.5 i found sflow does not support egress sampling for multicast, broadcast, or unknown unicast packets. but the nxos 7 documentation states egress sflow of multicast traffic requires hardware multicast globaltxspan configuration. which i tried. the other sentence in there drove me totally nuts for an ingress sflow sample of multicast packets, the out port is reported as multiple ports with the exact number of egress ports. this is not supported on cisco nexus 9300ex and fxp platform switches. like, what does this even mean? i would interpret it as you can see how many interfaces an incoming packet will go to, but not on your device. but that should not affect what i can see on the sampled egress packet, right? i assume that either i am not smart enough to read the documentation correctly or the documentation is not coherent. so my question is is it possible to correctly sample the information for egress multicast traffic with my switch and if so, what needs to be done. if it is not possible i am interested how well other vendors support sflow monitoring of multicast packet especially arista. is it only cisco implementing it weirdly or is there a bigger reason for this. im also thinking about possible alternatives for my implementation and if you think they could be possible 1. combine the snooping and group report with the input data show ip igmp snooping groups. this would be possible but is no true monitoring. i wouldnt know when the switch does not pass a packet. 2. cycle the sflow monitoring port. if i monitor only one port at a time i always know where a one multicast enters and where it leaves 3. i look at some other interface data counters or something similar if there are any correlations i can use to match output multicasts to interfaces in some way. if you have any ideas id appreciate your help. || "
prometheus network monitoring,"hello all need some guidance here. i currently manage a smallmedium enterprise network with nexus 3k, nexus 2348 and nexus 9k switches in the datacenter. theres some intermittent slowness observed with some legacy applications and i need to identify whats causing it. we use solarwinds to monitor the infrastructure and nothing jumps out to me as the culprit. no oversubscription, no bottlenecks, no interface errors on the hosts where the application or database server is hosted. tried to show packet captures to prove that theres no network latency but nobody listens. is there any tool out there that can help really dissect this issue and point us in the right direction? at this point, i just need the problem to get resolved. thanks. || nexusshow interface counters errors the column all the way to the right is outdiscards. pay very close attention to that column. hit the space bar a bunch of times until you see indiscards. pay very close attention to that column, just to be thorough. solarwinds isnt precise enough to tell you if congestion is occurring. if eth11 is a 10gbe interface and eth12 is a 10gbe interface, and they both are receiving a 6gbps stream of traffic destined to a device on eth13, which is also a 10gbe port then you have 12gbps of traffic trying to fit into a 10gbps interface. this is congestion in a lan switch. since not all the traffic can fit, some of it must be buffered and sent when time allows. no switch has unlimited buffer memory. when buffer exhaustion occurs, and a packet must be dropped it will show up as an outdiscard. nexusshow interface flowcontrol flowcontrol is dumb. in my opinion, flow control should be disabled on every switch interface unless the device connected to that interface specifically says flow control is a bestpractice in its implementation guide. flowcontrol is a primitive form of early congestion control. when enabled on both ends, if either device estimates that it is about to run out of buffer memory capacity it can fire a pause frame at the connected device and demand that that device stop sending any traffic for some number of microseconds. from your switchs perspective, an rxpause is a pause frame received from the device connected on that switchport. a server is ashing this switch to hold up for a second. from your switchs perspective an txpause is a pause frame sent from this switch to the connected device asking that device to hold up for a second. flowcontrol doesnt care about qos prioritization. flowcontrol doesnt understand that some packets are more important than others. this is because flowcontrol is dumb. if your switch and the connected server have both negotiated flowcontrol to be on and you are not seeing any pause requests then neither device is crying for help to manage congestion. this suggests no congestion in the network is occurring. if your switch has flowcontrol disabled but you are receiving assloads of pause requests from the connected device, that device is the problem. he cant handle all the traffic you are sending him. send less traffic, or tune optimize that device so he can handle traffic better. here is the story you are trying to establish and support using data. the nexus 93180 switch only has 40mbytes of packet buffer memory in the whole box. that is the sum total of all possible storage in the switch for application traffic. solarwinds can help you depict how much total traffic is flowing through the switch at any given time. 40mb of storage is a very slim fraction of one second before it runs out of buffer capacity and starts dropping packets. if you arent dropping packets then the packets must be entering and exiting the switch really damned fast, if they werent youd fill the buffer and start dropping. a solarwinds graph might not be granular enough to show that interface utilization hit 135 utilization for eight seconds, but it is granular enough to show that you dropped 800 packets in the past 5 minutes on the switch port the server is connected to. if you arent dropping packets then you delivered them in a timely manner. if the network delivered the sql query request to the sql server in a tiny fraction of one second, and then you had to wait 37 seconds to receive the database response the problem isnt the network, the problem is inside the sql server. the usual suspects inside a database server are inefficient query bad programming cpu too busy inefficient query bad programming not enough ram inefficient query bad programming disk response time too slow inefficient query bad programming record locking multiple db operations are fighting over the exact same data at the same time inefficient query bad programming in case i forgot to mention it, more often than any other rootcause for a database performance problem is the developer is hitting the sql server with an inefficient database query. now, to answer your other question is there a product that can solve this? yes, but its expensive as fuck. what youre asking about is an application performance monitoring tool. the products listed in the topright quadrant are considered by gartner to be the bestofbreed products. if you engage cisco to watch a demo of appdynamics, or engage the dynatrace people for a demo of their product your whole department should start foaming at the mouth over how fantastically useful the data is. they can tell you exactly why your application is so slow. right down to the query string that is causing the problem, and can suggest a way to write a new string that might work better. this is gonna cost you an arm, a leg and somebodys kidney. but thats not your problem. let them make their sales pitch and let the big boss say no. you will have done your job bringing in a toptier solution to the problem. || sounds like the appdatabase teams need to do more digging instead of blaming the network || i recommend taking 2 concurrent packet captures, then analyze in wireshark 1 capture at the sourceclient and 2 capture at the destination serverapplication || smarter replies before mine, but this happened to us when the asic was saturated. might have 10g interfaces but commutative traffic on all interfaces causes traffic to buffer as the asic is saturated. check switch model capacity."

prometheus network monitoring,"hi folks, been trying to figure out an issue with remoting into my office for about a week now and going a bit in circles. im running debian 11 and using remmina to rdp over a paidfor vpn service yes, i am rdping into a windows network. it worked well for about 3 years, now drama. what i would like to understand is why, when i monitor traffic with wireshark, my outgong ip is that of my wifi interface and not the tun0 interface. i tested the same setup on a windows laptop, and on windows the outgoing ip matched tun0. so am i right to think that my networks settings on the debian laptop are wrong? on both laptops, the vpn is setting up the tun0 interface, per usual. on windows the tun0 ip matches the ip displayed on the vpn gui. on debian, the tun0 ip appears to be random, but, when i manually set tun0 to to match the vpn ip which is what i believe the remote server expects to talk to, the tun0 interface vanished from the route table, and i even had to reboot to get it back up. lastly, i am sorry, but the way route tables are displayed just hurts my brain, and the all the documentationyoutube videos i have ingested in an attempt to understand them are either poorly explained or too surface level or i am just too smoothbrained and need it dumbed down to a 1st grade level. with the vpn on, my route table starts with via random tun0 ip dev tun0 via wifi ip dev wlp2s0 then there are several pages of ips directed to wifi ip which disappear from the routing table when the vpn is off so i assume these are hops through the vpn tunnel. if these settings are correct, i am confused, because having seems to be saying that 1 everything goes through the tunnel and 2 everything goes though wlp2s0 at the same time. my brain expects it to be something more like via tun0 ip dev tun0 tun0 ip via wifi ip not sure what the gateway would be here dev wlp2s0 to me this would be saying that first everything goes through tun0, then tun0 routes to wlp2s0 to talk to the remote server. please help untangle my brain. || remote access vpn software creates a tunnel interface. when the vpn is established, your route table is modified based on your configuration to route all traffic fulltunnel or some traffic splittunnel across the vpn tunnel interface. if you are configured to full tunnel, this will inject a default route 0.0.0.00 to route via the tunnel interface. if you are configured for splittunnel, this will inject the specific routes configured to route via the tunnel interface. if you do a route print and ipconfigall, youll be able to identify your physical and virtual network interfaces, this will help you understand what ip address your network interfaces are mapped too, the routes installed in your route table and their metrics. lastly, youll see a route via your local network adapter wired or wifi with a default route 0.0.0.0 via your default gateway of the lan interface crucially, this is how your local network adapter knows how to reach the internet. || a few quick questions to help me answer. the tunnel interface is usually created by the remote access vpn software. do you have a vpn client installed on the device? can you share a route print the route table of your device when disconnected to the vpn and in a connected state to help me visualise? the server youre referring to is usually known as vpn gateway this is usually a firewall or device that is hosting the vpn gateway. when you connect to the vpn, youre establishing a vpn connection to the vpn gateway configured in your vpn client to build a vpn tunnel."
