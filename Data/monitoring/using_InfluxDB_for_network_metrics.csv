using InfluxDB for network metrics,"for context, i have a 1g wan link coming in bridge mode direct to a ucgfiber, and sfp28 dac going to a connectx6 lx on a windows 11 machineno im not going to engage in a conversation about why im not using linux when i force negotiate the sfp link to 1g speed via the routerverified it updates on the cx6 as well certain speedtest sites throttle the result to pretty consistent around 200mb for ookla and fast.com adjacent tests, and 500mb for cloudflare and googles speedtest. wifimam, ubiquitis built in, waveform, all show the full speed, and downloadsfile transfers in and out of network all seem unaffected. when i manually set the link to 10g, all the speed tests show the full 1g speed. again, everything else is unaffected either way. to my understanding, this should be the opposite if anything. for the record, everything is fully updated, latest driversfirmware, direct link to cpu, full pcie speeds, all offloads enabled, no jumbo frames, no flow control, etc. nothing crazy enabled just basic tweaks for windows. my only idea is that officially the connectx6 lx only supports one 1g protocol and its having an issue communicating that? i have no issue keeping it at 10g, but from all my understandings this should be the less ideal way to set it up, i guess this is more for my understanding than anything. maybe im missing something obvious. || i wouldnt be surprised if the nic, dac or switch doesnt support 1gbps while using a sfp28 dac cable or it could only work with certain sfp28 dac cables. its going to come down to software on the devices. i have seen switches and nics that will refuse to use 10gbps when you plug in a sfp28 transceiver. it sees its sfp28 so it will only use 25gbps. just because its a sfp28 port and cable does not guarantee it can handle lower speeds. try using a sfp dac and it might work correctly and if not, try a sfp cable."

using InfluxDB for network metrics,"edit found the issue, see comments. hi network experts, i am a jackofall trades, master of none. if my assumptions or plans are stupid, please tell me. i currently have a network with 200 hosts, simple local ad, hyperv, no complicated stuff. we recently purchased a sns220. my current plan is to set it up between our current router and the internal network. in the current setup, i have where all my hosts reside in. this network is connected directly to our consumergrade yeah, i know router, which provides internet connection via our public 30. now, i would like to set up the stormshield in between as a first step in the right direction internal network stormshield router. in the long term, i am also planning to switch ip ranges, implement some vlans and use more subnets. my test implementation currently looks like this host 10.0.0.24 stormshield port 2 10.0.0.254 stormshield port 1 192.168.10.18 router 192.168.10.1 however, for some reason, i can not reach anywhere behind the stormshield from my test host. i configured the ip addresses for the stormshield directly on the interfaces, not using a bridge. both interfaces are set to internal protected. then, i set the nat filter preset to 4 low and disabled the vulnerability manager. all packages from my test host to anywhere on the or the internet seem to disappear in a black hole, and i cant find any reason for it. also, the dashboard logs a lot of issues called ip address spoofing type1, describing blocked packages, where the source is the stormshield itself and the destination are stormshield update and telemetry servers. i guess i am just missing a small piece of configuration somewhere, but i cant find out what or where this is. can anyone here give me a hint or some tips please? || i found the issue. first of all, my interface 1 needed to be set to external public instead of internal protected. second, i needed a nat rule which translated the source address."
using InfluxDB for network metrics,"hi everyone, over the past year, i have started to implement a new ip structure for a few of our locations, moving away from a ghastly 10.0.x.x16 site with little to no vlans. my primary site in question has a new ip prefix for the location ie 10.10.x.x16 and contains many business related vlans. this location has a warehouse used for deliveries. through the old vlan structure, the warehouse was connected via ipsec cisco asa5505 to the primary site on a network. the asa5505 is being replaced and has been neglected and forgotten about by past it staff. the warehouse contains only a few handheld barcode scanners and 23 aps. as you can imagine, all of that traffic was on the 10.60 network and there was never any consideration for separate ssid vlan or apdevice management vlan by the staff prior. part of my new ip structure, i have created and implemented a management vlan. for this warehouse, i am unsure what the best practice is to proceed, regarding ip design. what my intentions are with this warehouse is to deploy a management vlan 1, ssid vlans 23, data vlan 1. below are a few options i have been thinking of. both locations will need to remain connected via ipsec tunnel. 1. extend my primary site management vlanssid vlans via vxlanipsec to the warehouse and pass the existing primary site vlans to the warehouse only those that are required. 2. create a separate set of vlans for the warehouse only. 1. ie primary site management vlan 32, warehouse vlan 132 i need to spread them out due to other existing vlans 3. other option is to use a new site prefix, ie 10.11.x.x16 but that doesnt feel right and feels wasteful. a site like this will have at most 10 wireless connections at any one time, so the demand is low. i feel like option 2 may be a good fit, as i have done this with another building that has two tenants that are owned by us, but not fully. tennant1 ssid vlan 40, tennant2 ssid vlan 140. the team i am working with doesnt have much input as they dont have much experience in this field hence the large 16 and 12 vlans. if anybody has a suggestion on how i can handle this in the most standard way, i would appreciate it. || i like a prefix followed by a set vlan in the third octet. 99 of stuff can be a 24 so all my sites are 10.site.vlanid.endpoint then i have all myv sites have the same vlans present. yes this can mean you have 1 ip in, for example the upspdu vlan.. but thats ok. depending on your size this should be pretty scalable and easy to swap to || i work for a global company that has multiple businesses. each business unit gets assigned one or multiple large blocks of private ip space but we are expected to divide and manage those as needed for each site within the business unit. for comparison we have 16s assigned by corporate and then turn around and break those up into 20s, 21s, and 22s based on site size. those are further vland to include multiple subnets depending on size. so we might end up with a large subnet for corporate data, another for corporate wireless, subnets for management and servers, and others as needed. even on our smallest sites, a 22 is assigned since it allows us a management, server, data, and wireless subnets. as needed. clarifying here that for a really small site, that 22 assignment will end up being 4 x 24s. understand here you cannot view large assignments as, this will never be used, but, what if they move this location to a bigger building, or, what if they merge this location with another new one, or any number of unforeseen growth practices that can happen. also for what its worth, dont extend vlans between sites unless you absolutely have to. keep the broadcast domain, and routing of said subnets specific to the site in question, bridging things across wan connections is not ideal at all. again, just because you have 16s available doesnt mean they have to be used as 16. break those up. be mindful of a ton of future uses that you may want additional subnets for. in reference to the really good advice uphuzzle90 gives below, try to ensure the ip assignment schema can also line up with international, regional or even metro based assignments. something like 10.8.x.x is the se region with further ranges divided in there that define those sites based on sizing. or something like 10.50.x.x is north america, 10.100.x.x is emea, etc. think of how those ips will be used for both routing and security future needs in mind. ensuring routing works when youve already got a schema for your region makes things so much easier, the same for ensuring different business units or regions dont have access to others unless needed, again, youre leveraging your ip schema as the point of routing and rulesets, so keep that in mind versus just assigning, the next available, without pause for trying to ensure they are placed correctly within the overall plan. || try not to use vlan1 for management, just bad practice."
using InfluxDB for network metrics,"hey! im pretty new to networking and would like to setup dell unity storage in our company to be visible via network. i found out i have to setup a separate vlan for that, but i do not specifically know how to configure that vlan. we are using cisco c930048t for our core switches and c920048t4x for edge switches. only guide i found on the web was the following create and name the new vlan conf t vlan 30 name iscsivlan exit and to then set the ports so they can access it interface gigabitethernet1048 switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 1, 30 exit is there anything else i should config along with the mt9000... can someone guide me through the process thanks! || for the switch port configuration, i think youll want those set as access ports, not trunk ports. interface gi1048 switchport mode access switchport access vlan 30 || its really important you understand what iscsi is and how it is used before you configure any ports. iscsi only needs to exist between the storage array itself and the hosts that are attaching to that block storage. can you tell me what type of servershosts are attaching? often times its an esx or hyperv host that requires block storage. assuming its one of the two, and also assuming there is only a single iscsi network, i would configure your switch ports to be trunk and only allow prune that specific vlan. making it a trunk port, from the beginning, allows you the flexibility to easily add an additional iscsi vlan later. many sans would have an a side and b side so two iscsi networks. hope that helps. || ... and set mtu up to switches maximum and disable flow control on the switch ports. || jumbo frames on all storage ports is essential. while i did not need a layer 3 interface on my storage vlans i created one anyway for completeness sake then i would apply an acl that would isolate the vlan. || is there anything to be said about the likes of an iscsi focused switch like dell units? my knowledge here is limited, however in the past when ive had to get involved ive setup fuly redundant hardware switch a, switch b config and enabled iscsi mode or what have you. in reality, thats like some qos driven optimisation or similar. ignoring jumbo frames, is there any thing else being done to these devices like larger buffers you wouldnt see in other enterprise grade gear?"
using InfluxDB for network metrics,"hey folks, my company is in the process of implementing thousandeyes, and im new to the tool. ive gone through the documentation and understand there are different types of tests like http server, page load, network, dns, etc., but im trying to get a clearer picture for a realworld use case. my manager has asked me to explain how we can effectively utilize thousandeyes in our environment cisco sdwan , webex contact center beyond just running basic tests. were mostly interested in improving visibility and troubleshooting for network and application performance, but im not sure what the best practices are, or how others are leveraging it daytoday. would appreciate if anyone can share common use cases in your organization what tests you rely on the most any tips or gotchas for managingautomating alerts or dashboards things you wish youd known when getting started || thousandeyes falls in to the category of products known as digital experience monitoring. rum real user monitoring is fulfilled by endpoint agents, a lightweight agent gathering statistical performance data from your enduser laptops desktops. the cloud enterprise agents perform synthetic transaction monitoring the endpoint agents have a very limited set of stm tests they can also run. these are the network, dns, etc., tests that you referred to. rum is great as a triage tool. when joe calls the helpdesk and says i had a terrible webex call, the endpoint data can point to causes like high cpu, poor firsthop performance, bad wifi signal, etc.. this affords helpdesk the visibility to close tickets before they go up to more advanced engineers responsible for client engineering, networking, app owners, you get the idea. synthetic tests are best used to evaluate either critical services, or, critical network paths. think about a sla attached to a customerfacing biz app. you may want to run synthetic tests from a combination of cloud, endpoint, and enterprise agents, to effectively measure your service availability latency. i would try to pick agents that best represent the locations of your users. if your apps are primarily you can validate that not only is the socket open, but that you are getting back the correct http response code or script for more advanced web workflows. otherwise you fake it with an agenttoserver test and point to the appropriate combination of protocol port, you just wont negotiate an actual session. you may also want to run agenttoagent synthetic tests to validate critical network paths. this could be sitetosite, sitetocloud, or even within a dc or lan. this could leverage a combo of enterprise and cloud agents as needed. id start by making a list of critical services, critical users, and frequent problem areas. build your tests around that and see what you learn. as others have mentioned, their licenses are big money, and you want to maximize the value. engage your cisco account team as they will be thrilled to help you get set up the more you succeed, the more likely leadership will want to buy more, so theyre incentivized. btw... this does not replace traditional flow and packet based performance monitoring. || depends on your budget hoe much monitoring you can enable. or.. tokens || te is very overpriced for most folks if you are just going to pinghttp test from your branches, there is free software that can do this. also note they charge you per test, despite your enterprise agents running on your hardware. if you rely on a lot of internetbased apps, it can be very helpful, or if you dont have smokeping or something already. || for sdwan monitoring, then you can set up tests on the overlay, then tests for the underlay and program the sdwan to drop the underlay test packets down. for webex, there are two things you may want to monitor. on the enterprise agents, set up an agent to agent test from your enterprise agents to the webex cloud agent that your site will probably communicate with. then for your endpoint agents, enable the on demand test for webex for any other application it depends on the application and how the application works. || im a var and helped a few clients stand up thousandeyes for sdwan visibility and app performance, especially around things like webex, salesforce, and o365. the most useful tests have been continuous http server tests for saas monitoring, bgp path visualization, and endpoint agents for branchtocloud visibility. dashboards and alerting take a bit of finetuning early on, especially if you want to avoid noise. shoot me a dm if you want more infosupport! || you need to make sure your agents are deployed in the right locations. can be deployed in the right locations and you have a good story around updating and patching them. without going into very specific tests the 1 minute agent to agent tests are pretty good. they open a tcp stream and spread packets throughout that 1 minute window giving good data on latency, packet loss etc once agents are deployed everything else can be configured. enterprise agents to cloud providers, custom tests, whatever. te has a good terraform provider, its a nice easy way to turn tests offon, save on credits, document the tests for future reference and learn a new skill in the process. || were a cisco shop and we upgraded our network recently so we got a ton of te entitlements. im honestly not finding it very useful. there have been a handful of cases where an endpoint agent would have been nice to have but we were told the minimum you can buy is 100. wed probably only ever use 5 at once so theres no way wed pay tens of thousands for access to the endpoint agents. otherwise the only real use i got out of it was setting up a bgp monitor in our network which allows me to see what as hops a packet will take. not useful at all but interesting to know. not a very helpful comment but id figure id share. edit endpoint agent, not enterprise. || disclaimer i am not from ciscothousandeyes. i am just one of their happy customers. i share some details below, which are my personal opinion. under the hood it uses common troubleshooting tools like ping, traceroute, curl, dig, etc. in a way it is nothing new or can be replicated easily. real strong points of thousandeyes 1 if you use have 90 cisco gear in your environment, you can deploy an agent on supported cisco devices almost anywhere. we have a few agents at each branch sites. it is that simple to install. the agents are quite stable. common issues i have seen is the hosting hardware failing or internet thousandeyes is saas so ... acting up. 2 cloud agents. these are enterprise agents but hosted by te. this is really good as it gives you the option to probe from the internet. you can use it to probe other stuff in the internet or maybe a public facing enterprise resource. 3 ability to do ad hoc probes from hundreds of agents. very nice for troubleshooting. 4 if you set up ongoing tests, you have historical data on what you are probing for up to 2 months. very useful or rcas or to proof that the issue was not on network side. 5 gui is nice and easy to navigate. support is excellent. i personally rank them higher than tac and meraki support. success stories 1 identifying exactly a routing point of failure in isp upstream and having isp to change the design for that particular link. 2 application monitoring. you will be surprised with what this can pick up, from server issues to dns issues to dns routing issues and of course network issues. cons 1 it is very expensive. 2 its value is only as good as the usecase you can come up with. what you should note 1 since thousandeyes uses icmp amongst others under the hood, check with your security guys if they allow such traffic. if they dont then you lose like 30 of the value from no path visualization data. 2 think hard about your usecases. while i am happy with thousandeyes, i admit that it is not the solution to everything and there are usually simpler cheaper alternatives out there. hope this helps."
using InfluxDB for network metrics,"hello all. in my homelab i have a cisco nexus n3kc3064pq10gx. this is acting as my core switch doing all my intervlan routing. i have a cisco catalyst 3850 trunked to this switch via a port channel using two 10gb dac connections. the 3850 is my access switch which has clients and servers connecting to it. i have a truenas server serving up smb shares to my network and a synology nas acting as my backup server. i bought a couple dual 10gb sfp cards for these servers and would like to connect them to my nexus over 10gb instead of my catalyst. this is where i have some questions. once i connect these via the 10gb interfaces i want them to be using jumbo frames. from the research, i have done it looks like you can only turn jumbo frames on globally or on the specific l3 svis. would the right way to approach this be to create a vlans for the truenassynology storage interfaces and turn mtu 9216 on for the svi? i am just a little confused as to how to set this up without causing disruption for the other clients in my network. i am more familiar with catalyst than i am with nexus although i have gained a good amount of working knowledge on nxos using it here in my homelab. i appreciate your help and time. thank you. || once i connect these via the 10gb interfaces i want them to be using jumbo frames. yes, you can set the mtu on the svi. but that would just allow the inter vlan routing. youd still need the l2 mtu to be set for the switch. you also dont want to have an svi that connects to the internet set to a larger than 1500 byte mtu, otherwise youll likely have some mismatch problems. there are generally three mtus on a given infrastructure to care about l2 mtu this is the maximum frame size that can be forwarded via switching. this is often a global setting system mtu 9216 or something like that. i cant remember if the nexus 3000s use the percos mtu. l3 mtu this is the maximum frame size a router interface will take, pull off the ethernet frame, then route that packet. the other routed interfaces should also be the same mtu, lest you have fragmentation routing between them. system mtu the host mtu is generally either 1500 or 9000, but could be anything in between or even some even smaller or larger. generally either set it for 1500 or 9000 or something weird in certain vpn scenarios. the problem with jumbo frames is theres often not much of a benefit anymore, and theres issues with mtu mismatch. in 1999, you could more than double throughput on a gigabit nic by doing jumbo frames. today, various optimizations and high speed multicore cpus obviate most of that advantage. you can do a test yourself on performance with jumbo and nonjumbo frames. i suspect the results will be similar, which if thats the case, id just use regular mtu."
using InfluxDB for network metrics,"from what ive seen so far, most switches have 4 possible span sessions per switch. so you usually group your connections to the switch into vlans or just pass through say 8 ports to a single span session. problem is, as everyone knows, span sessions can miss packets if you push the ports youre monitoring hard enough. given that the span port is 1gbps and each of the monitored ports is also 1gbps, its easy to see that it doesnt take much to push things for packets to start getting dropped when you even have just two links per span session. so i was thinking, why not simply use 2 twisted pair ethernet cables an 4 twisted pairs for the span links? in other words, when making your ethernet cables, simply only use 2 twisted pairs rather than 4. this will force network speeds of that link to 100mbps. for low bandwidth applications, this should still be more than enough speed and this way, you can have 5 ethernet links per span session without overwhelming your 1gbps span link. what do you guys think? || you can configure port speeds to lower rates without having to pull pairs out of cables but less and less gear even supports 100mbps. crippling your production network just to meet span port restrictions seems bonkers and speeds are only ever going up. the correct answer is taps and packet brokers. || thats exactly what scotts throwing star does. plus you can tap right in, without a span. but in todays world, where would a 100mbit tap be even remotely useful? were in need of 100 and 400gbit taps, not 100mbit. || isnt this where taps would be used? || as others have said, you can just set an interface to negotiate for a lower speed. but then youre going to limit your hosts to 100 megabit. this adds latency takes 10 times as long to send a frame and if you get to over 100 megabit, youre going to drop packets. span would see all the packets, but youd have packet drops for your app. || technically, ethernet only uses two pairs anyway, so buggering a cable in hopes that it might cause your autonegotiation to fail is not a very reliable strategy. at that point you cant be sure it will negotiate 100. it might still negotiate 1000, and just drop packets like mad or not. if you need to monitor 1g data aggregate, use a faster port. there are 2.5g and 5g ports, but 10g is probably just as easy. the cisco 9300 can support up to 66 sessions with rspan destinations. if you need to manage the bandwidth, qos policy is probably the better answer."
using InfluxDB for network metrics,"my whole job used to be network design, install and config, but that was more than a decade ago. i may be starting a new job thats exclusively networking, and i realize that my foundations are solid, but there are a lot of fiddly little things that i dont remember or assume have changed, so id appreciate help answering any of the below when first configuring new cisco equipment, do you still access it via serial port? is there some special name for a usbserial port adapter? in a pc environment, what software do i use to access the cli on a cisco switch? what are the three most significant change to enterprise networking in the last decade? what else should i have asked about? || its just a new cable type, easier to use than the old rs232 cable. i use securecrt for cli access, but there are loads, putty is free. networking is still all the layers it was, still all the same protocols. port speeds have increased dramatically, and weve got way more high speed ports. firewalls can inspect and block way more than ever before. the cloud is very popular, as is automation. || the compact cisco switches 9200 now exclusively use micro usb. all others use the traditional rollover cable. all of the 9000 series cisco switches now have a management port in its own mgmtvrf just like the 3850s had thats handy for provisioning. autoinstall still works, so that hasnt changed, but now ztp allows you to run a python script within a guest shell to dynamically configure a device. its pretty slick. sdwan was around 10 yrs ago, and still is. cisco changed their automation platforms, while i havent used nso, catalyst center dna center, which is ciscos switch and ap management solution, is expensive and not great to work with. if you can do things with it programmatically, then its ok, if youre clicking buttons then i dont think it saves you time. cisco licensing has gotten very expensive. theyre done selling ios switches, so their current cheapest model is the fixed chassis 9200l. you have to buy a dna subscription when you purchase it, but you dont have to renew. there are licensing levels too. the asr is still around, albeit in smaller packages now, they run the same iosxe as the catalyst line, but its not really the same. netconf restconf can now be used to configurevalidate state on the 9k catalyst switches. iosxe, and many of the cisco competitors, now support streaming telemetry. basically a logging device can subscribe to data from the switch, and you build pretty dashboards and alarms when something is out of spec. release notes are more important than ever, now that switches are capable of running more services, which means more bugsvulnerabilities. its still a fun job. welcome back. || for the most part things are similar. you can use user guides that will be your best friend. things youll need is an ethernet cable, and a serial cable. i wave a serial. i personally like using securecrt, but im sure you have used putty, you can still use that if you want || try mobaxterm. you can access switches remote, console, servers, etc. very nice compared to putty. still the same serial cable. although some now have a micro usb on one end and usb on the other. or buy an adapter. console to remote. enable ssh. use of mlag over traditional stacks, firewalls at the edge not routers, and ai is hacking you now so chop chop on acls. you got this, literally the rest is the same. || console port putty large push into automation and sdwan technology || i automated everything using day zero concept with python ie 300 switches in one week. no more console cables just oob devices on the rack. pure networking in my case i havent touched any device physically for years. || lets hope your new job is part of a network team, otherwise, as a solo position, you have a ton of catching up to do with no mentors to lead the way. || most things are the same. spineleaf vxlan is now becoming more common in the campus network. this was usually only found in the data centre. i still carry a usbserial lead with my laptop everywhere i travel. also majorcommon configuration is mostly done via http apis now. netdevops is the latest buzzword and ansible being your friend with configuration drift being the main problem trying to be solved today as more companies look for making efficiencies. || what kind of environment are you in isp? enterprise? smb? imo isp and smb havent changed that much. enterprise is probably where more changes are happening, but many organisations still do things in old ways. more automation, more managed networking like meraki, evpnvxlan overlay networking etc. for things like cctingonne to switches this will depend heavily on the company. i often use serial for initial setup, but many other places probably use zero touch provisioning systems. firewall and security importance have increased drastically. just approach it like anything else. ask for the companies documentation and read carefully, be sure to ask all the dumb questions like how they configure switches and note it down. make sure you attempt each operation so you can find the things you dont know. procedures and common sense are hard to google, but anything technical can be. || yes and no. there are some new products and new ways of doing as compared to old. the cisco viptella sdwan boxes are configured through vmanage instead of cli. cli is used only for the initial setup. traditional routers like asrisr or cat switches follow the same old method and cisco aci is like sdwan and hosted controllers. cli is used in troubleshooting as some times what you see on the gui is not the config you see on cli in terms of protocol, there are new ones like omp which works differently from good old bgp. you get to meraki stack, the methods of deployment has changed from traditional cisco. you should read about meraki there is a lot of scarcity for people who understand traditional networking and cloud networking. you should learn about them especially azure virtual wan, aws cloud wan and google cloud wan. hope this helps || more 3rd party sfps are actually reliable fs, axiom, etc. despite cisco and others not dropping their prices. imho, juniper is doing well with their mist ai cloud service. cisco is still my favorite give me notepad, putty, and a few minutes i can have a router ready to go. about 6 more minutes and i can have a switch, since they take a lot longer to boot. 10 years later, ill swap them out! || any usb to serial over any terminal emulator will do. amazon has many usb to rs232 adapter for cheap. most significant change is automation i reckon. and software defined architecture... however, most still boils down to troubleshooting ports trunks and protocols... like stp, bgp, eigrp, ospf, etc... || for cli as others have said putty of secure crt. i just use powershell tho, works for most things except really old devices...or wsl...i mean thats one kind of fiddly thing....ive found securecrt is fiddly in another way and dont like it muchit just forgets its config to connect to linux servers very occasionally, i mean its havent had this happen i dont use it but ive helped other eng with it, usually matter of sshing to the linux box from somewhere else || super putty putty || hey im looking for people that know naas for a small scale consulting project. mostly on advice and strategy. knowledge of the players eg lumen, packet fabric, etc important. if anyone would be keen for a few hours work message me directly pls! happy for it to be a moonlight thing, there arent any short timelines. alternatively can anyone suggest resources for this kind of work? since its a small project a lot of the hiring websites ive seen online arent quite right. thanks!"
using InfluxDB for network metrics,"if you were creating multiple points to point l2vpns on an mplssr network. what would you think your needed label depth would need? there are over 100 devices on your isis domain, all in your mpls network. from my understanding you dont need a label for each device using sr, you only need to know the labels for your l2vpn. is this correct? || generally 3 is enough, transport service and an extra for bypass for frr depending on their implimentation. higher label stacks can occur when you are doing different types of nni with other mpls domains. || its been a while since i delved into segment routing, but the basicdefault label stack would consist of two labels, similar to regular ipmpls. the service label doing the vrfinstance segregation and the transport label. with sr tbe transport label by default is usually the global sid of the remote destination router. if you are trying to do complex traffic engineering or link selection then your stack would contain more segment labels on top identifying the sids for the linksdevices in the middle of the path. so by default, yes you only need the global sid of the remote router for tagging. || generally, good practice is anywhere the igp is srmpls should be knowledgeable of it. if not you risk blackholing your traffic. also a label is needed anywhere you want l2 and l3vpn to happen otherwise traffic will be dropped as they wont have any knowledge of the traffic not told to them."
