SNMP tools,"i, as im sure many, have been really struggling with the halfassed or generally poor support from vendors when using protocols like yang. im not here to poo poo on either or debate why cli scraping is better or worse than yang. however, i am interested in what other people in the industry are doing with regard to workflows for figuring out how to program against a new devices netconfyang interface. my current workflow, to get started and probably optimize, is loading the device and its yang models into ill gather the current device config via netconf from this tool and store it in a file. ill then go into the cli of the device and make the changes im testing. via yangsuite, ill pull the config again, store in a new text file and then diff the two. hopefully, this gives me the namespaces and xpath values that i need to use to dig into the specific yang models. this is clearly not very efficient and im wondering if theres a better way to do this. ultimately, im aiming to make jinja templates to handle routine system level things, banners, logging, snmp, etc, and then more specific things like service creationmodificationremoval that might do things like modify interface configurations, configure layer 2 or 3 items. like i said, im sure theres more than one way to do it and im curious how we can collectively make this process better for everyone. || this is probably the hardest part of the whole workflow if you need to mock up the structure of a complex block of config then indeed thats probably the best way to do it for now. once you have an overall structure in place and you need to add or remove a feature or two its usually pretty easy to track it down on its own in the model and then add the required field. ill give you an example from my workflow. i have a routine that generates interface configs from netbox, and i recently needed to disable proxy arp on a subset of interfaces. since we use openconfig for our interface definitions i looked at and tried to find anything related to proxy arp, and ended up finding openconfiginterfacesinterfaceroutedvlanproxyarpconfigmode, which allows me to set what i needed to set, so it was just a matter of adding that leaf to the config generation module. sometimes, when dealing with native models, i will just open the yang file for the model in a text editor and search for strings that i would consider to be likely names of fields based on functionality i.e. if you want to set nexthopself on a bgp peer, search for nexthop, and in iosxrs native bgp models youll find a leaf called nexthopself under a neighbors address family, and from there you can often discern the structure as well. you could in theory reverse engineer a whole block of config using that approach, but i oftentimes cheat and instead configure it on the device and then do a gnmi get to see what it looks like modeled. once you do this dozens or hundreds of times you start to get a good intuition on where to find things. || besides yangsuite, i found that getting the path with gnmic is useful i like is clibased and even if i get too much output, i can grep it. there is also a tool called that can help you get paths. and since you commented you are also using nso, one way to get the xpath is to configure something i dont remember if you have to commit or not and then do a dryrun dispaly xpath if you have to commit the config, then you do a show devices devices config ... display xpath in nso there more options useful when using the display option. in nso you can also evaluate xpaths for example adminncsconfig xpath eval devicesdeviceaddress devicesdeviceaddress 127.0.0.1 devicesdeviceaddress 127.0.0.1 devicesdeviceaddress 127.0.0.1 adminncsconfig xpath eval devicesdeviceaddress devicesdeviceaddress 127.0.0.1 a bit of disclaimer, i work for cisco and i dont maintain a network but found these resources useful."
SNMP tools,"hello, i was recenlty involved in a project in which our agency upgraded approximately 30 cisco 3850 switches to cisco 9300x models. our snmp monitoring tool reported several metrics including device temperature from all the 3850 switches. since we upgraded to the 9300x models and have rescanned the new devices with our monitoring tool, we do not see any temperature monitor availalbe to choose as one of our metrics. all the other metrics appear to be available to report back, but not temperature which is highly critical. we had an instance just yesterday where one of ac units went out in an mdf at one of our branchi sites, and we did not know until i luckily happend to go there for something not related. i would assume that cisco would not have done something to remove this capability in a cost saving measure, but before reaching out to them i wanted to get some feedback if anyone else has experienced or is familiar with this situation. || likely a problem with the monitoring tool. look up the oids and check them by hand. || cisco has changed the environmental snmp mib a few times, probably just need to load the right one or repoint it i dont have any 9300x off hand but id all but guarantee they have temp sensors because other hardware needs it and likely has active fan profiles i do have almost every 9xxx series devices though and every one of them has temp sensors and most actually have inlet and outlet as well which for more general environmental monitoring is nice || what monitoring system?"
SNMP tools,"hello redditors! my global company is neck deep in a discussion of moving to a fully converged purdue model for itot as the network is currently an it network only with ot vlans and physically isolated ot networks hanging about. one of the couple sticking points on the deployment model is whether to use cisco or rockwell industrial switches at the access layer in plc cabinets. the ot network core switches, asneeded distribution layer switches, and likely any nonplc cabinet access layer switches would all be cisco. its take is cisco throughout and ot wants rockwell in the plc cabinets. currently, ot and the plants have little to no network knowledge for day n support. ot merely wants the tools to be able to see what they want to see at that level, but seemingly without any concern for what happens when things break. im trying to educate myself better on both sides to help make an educated, objective recommendation. my questions are thus as we are a global organization, the manufacturer support is a big concern. cisco has a very extensive global support model with established slas for replacement hardware and onsite tech in all the countries we operate in, as far as i know. ive been told rockwell has some sort of distributor network, but i dont know much more than that. how do the two compare? rockwell stratix 5200s seem to be the current model going up against the newer cisco ie3x00 line. cisco only has dlr on the 3400, but i dont know how frequently that would be used, especially if we just connect all devices straight to the switches. are there other feature parity concerns to be aware of as far as management and ot protocols are concerned? i know rockwell switches are just cisco switches with a rockwell logo on them, but still cisco has their starred release system and rockwell has a system where they recommend releases as being ot stable. do the two overlap or even effectively the same or are they mutually exclusive? and is one better or worse than the other? rockwell switches have an addon to integrate into the io tree in the rockwell software. it sounds like just glorified snmp though, which it has observability platforms that can do all that and a lot more, including eventdriven automation, which were about to start dabbling into, ticketing system integration, etc. is this all accurate? how is cisco tac at dealing with otrelated switch issues vs. rockwell tac at dealing with typical it switchingnetworking issues? it is doing ansible automation on the it switches using ansible galaxys cisco collections. any caveats to using those on rockwell switches? anything else noteworthy that might be of concern given the above tia! || rockwell stratix switches are brand labelled cisco switches, like chevy vs gmc. the rockwell distributors are worldwide, you buy the stratix at the same place you get their plcs. functionality and performance between the stratix and cisco is equivalent. but stratix switches have additional automation equipment profiles defined in the switch. pricing is roughly the same. if it is going to manage the switches, get cisco. if ot or automation is going to manage them, get rockwell. || it ot engineer here it really depends on who going to support the switches. if rockwell is then sure, stratix. but if the end goal is to have a fully segregated it and ot network following the purdue model with your plcs networked to the ot network cisco assuming the ot switches are also cisco. the cli is similar but not 100 1 for 1 so its easier if all your switches are using the same brand. plus, its nice to cut down on the number of different flavors of switches you need to have in stock. || i work more with the it networking, but our ot areas do send the requests for ot switch configuration to my department. we went through a similar discussion last year in anticipating replacement of the large fleet of stratix 5700 that we have that have gone eos. we did a bake off of the stratix 5200 and the cisco ie3100. we found that for our use cases they were functionally identical, your use cases may very. rockwell just had a few extra items like macros and some qos policies, but since we did the bake off we could pull some of the rockwell specific items over to the cisco. surprisingly, we found that the cisco option was about 600800 cheaper per switch than stratix depending on the model. this was mostly due to the discount on cisco equipment we receive. one of the other things for us that we found is that it would be easier to to provide the needed feature sets with the cisco than the stratix with fewer models. ptp is a key feature our environment needs control of for motion servo equipment, and some of the stratix models wouldnt support ptp, but all the cisco models would. if you go cisco, skip buying the cisco branded sd cards those things are crazily overpriced. 480 for a 4gb card, no thanks. weve used 8 16gb san disk cards with no issues."

SNMP tools,"were evaluating opensource syslog servers and have narrowed it down to graylog and loki. currently, we use librenms for network monitoring, and graylog integrates well with librenms, making it easier to use with our existing setup. however, were looking to move to subminute polling, which librenms doesnt support, so were considering migrating to a prometheus grafana stack. this makes loki, with its tight grafana integration, an appealing option for the future. our end goal is to have both network monitoring metrics and syslog metrics on a single dashboard and to be able to alert based on a combination of the two. we also need to handle snmp traps effectively. how do graylog and loki handle snmp traps? is there a better solution for managing snmp traps in a prometheus grafana setup? wed love your input which do you recommend for highvolume syslog use cases? how do they compare in terms of performance, usability, and integration? any tips or lessons learned when using either tool? || why 1m polling? thats enough detection to enforce a 99.995 sla, and ive heard even cloudflare runs on 4 9s, not 5 only google, microsoft, and aws go that nuts. || full disclosure i work at graylog before that have run large graylog clusters in enterprise for many years. imo graylog and grafana are both very good at what they do but if you can only choose one youll be compromising on flexibility, capability, and ease of use. graylog is great for log management and the free graylog open version is very capable. it unfortunately does not support snmp traps, but you can use something like logstashs grafana is very good and telemetry, observability, and visualizations. its not as capable for log management though. i recommend testing both in parallel to see how they meet your needs. if you find youre able to do everything you want with only one, you can decomission the other. one of my favorite things about open source though is not having to compromise and pick and choose. || use the lgtm stack. loki for logging and grafana for visualization and alerting. use prometheus snmp exporter to get snmp data."
SNMP tools,"anyone have recommendations for a 3rd party toolprogram, or python or excel code, etc that produces a really nice graph and work flow when troubleshooting tcp throughput issues? maybe something you used at work and it grabs the data vian snmp or api, etc. a bonus would be if can import wireshark or csv traces but not required. a very basic example is the tcp stream graph in wireshark but something more informative and pretty for the layman. thank you. || the standard is flent. || something nice lol i like how it sounds like you are buying tcp throughput graphs as an anniversary present for your love || juniper paragon access assurance may be overkill but is a nice solution for pushing and analyzing test traffic."
SNMP tools,"hello, i work at an isp, and for a while weve been looking for a good pricequality ratio isp billing software. currently we are using an outdated selfwritten database management software, but we would like to transition to something more professional. currently we have around 4000 clients, 80 on gpon technology and rapidly upgrading the rest of the network to gpon too. i was wondering what yall are using, is there anything, which is well written and doesnt cost thousands of euros monthly. my other question is, we are looking to implement a new huawei olt management software too, where we can list olt ports, see client onus, optical signal, error messages, etc. any good solutionsrecommendations for this? maybe there is a software which can handle this task and the billing task too? thank you in advance! || if youre looking for fullblown ossbss systems ive used nisc and some old implementations of martin groups oasis and now sonar. for the love of god...stay away from sonar. halfbaked solution that constantly breaks, doesnt have any of the expected functionality builtin and is just a mess to work with. ive heard good things about innovative and my previous experience with nisc was very good. great system that easily integrated into adtran and calix platforms. good ossbss arent cheap and cheap ossbss systems arent good. || like another said, nisc is ok, but also built originally for electric coops and it shows. that said it does work pretty good. ive dealt with many isp billing and management systems over the years and none of them are perfect. they are all missing something you will need. ticketing, ips management, equipment automation, just having a customer circuit id. something big will be missing and you will have to design around it. also having dealt with huawei gpon, good luck, but you will be changing to adtran or calix in a year or two. || we use splynx for billing radius and smartolt for huawei olt management. both products are great if they are within your budget."
SNMP tools,"not sure if this is a common issue yall run into, but ive just spent the better part of 20hrs getting to the bottom of this issue so i figured id try and save someone elses sanity if they run into the same thing. one of our clients yealink t41s phones suddenly entered a boot loop. the phones were able to obtain an ip address via dhcp, and were briefly able to register with the pbx prior to powercycling themselves and repeating this process. after spending far too much time troubleshooting various different things updating the firmware on the phones, factory resetting our switches and firewalls, and contacting the pbx vendor, i ended up figuring out that my companies network management tool of choice, auvik, was the cause of the issue. it turns out that yealink phones, for whatever god forsaken reason, will reboot themselves if there is a lot of broadcast traffic on the network i.e snmp traffic. you could definitely get auvik running on the same network as the yealinks if you properly segment the phones onto a seperate vlan and subnet, but afaik i havent been able to locate a fix from yealink and the phones began working as intended once we removed our auvik collector from their onprem server. with that in mind we just opted to remove auvik from that network entirely as to prevent anyone from accidentally causing the issue again. tldr auvik and other network monitoring applications that send a large amount of snmp requests on a network will cause yealink phones to reboot themselves. on another note, 2 months into my first network engineering gig and im already feeling my wits start to fray i can see why people get burnt out of this field quickly. conversely, the high i got from finally fixing the issue is second to none. || if there is a lot of broadcast traffic on the network i.e snmp traffic why do you have snmp broadcasts on your network? its unicast by default, are you really having snmp traffic on broadcast addresses, i.e. for device discovery? || is there a reason you havent got the yealink phones on a dedicated isolated voice vlan ?"
SNMP tools,"i have been doing some rd for several network monitoring agents, with snmp, api, updown alerting, and opensourcefree as requirements. we are mostly monitoring routers, switches, and wifi hence the snmpapi req. librenms, ptrg free tier, netdata, prometheus, grafana, uptime kuma, etc. they would be hosted on a small mini pc or firewall appliance running proxmox andor dockerportainer. sending alert emails out when the agent is online and the network is up is easy. however, if the locally hosted nms agent is offline, opensourcefree, and not tied to a paid cloud service, obviously it cant send an email alert out if it has no internet or is just down. has anyone sorted out how to send an alert email if the network agent are offline using any of these free tools? looking to keep this as free or cheap as possible, strong preference for cloud hosting a master nms agent that could report if the local nms agents are down, but a selfhosted web server is also an option. || for monitoringthemonitoring we use a simple dead mans switch system. we have a main prometheus per network that monitors other prometheus instances. in the main prometheus instance we have an always firing alert that is sent to an external cronstyle monitoring service. if that heartbeat fails, an alert is sent to our pagerduty oncall. any of these would work, in alphabetical order by domain, we use one of them. || essentially how do you monitor the monitor? i can only speak for prtg out of your list, as its the only one ive used recently. generally, if were not using the dedicated hosted solution we will have the core server located in a data centre. we then use remote probes on each site to monitor the local infrastructure. if an internet connection or vpn goes down, or if the remote probe stops, it will drop from the core and send an alert. || uptimerobot? i dont think youre going to find a distributed nms you can host for free."
SNMP tools,"i am looking for a licensed tool or an open source platform which is capable of capturing 20 million snmp events per day, do suppression, and ultimately correlation. any suggestions? || elastic and prometheus w grafana are both products designed to scale, but they take elbow grease to get started with || could you clarify? suppression means not firing a correlated event. are you looking for alarm suppression? what kind of correlation do you need? alert? aggregation? || are there no licensed tools for this at such scale? like splunk? or dynatrace?"
