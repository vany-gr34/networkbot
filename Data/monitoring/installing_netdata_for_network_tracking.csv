installing netdata for network tracking,"hello, uk based but carrying out a mediumsized network install in the us, specifically miami. can anyone recommend any cable suppliers in that area, an electrical wholesale chain store i can purchase in person, or a reliably fast shipping online us supplier? thanks for reading || "
installing netdata for network tracking,"my whole job used to be network design, install and config, but that was more than a decade ago. i may be starting a new job thats exclusively networking, and i realize that my foundations are solid, but there are a lot of fiddly little things that i dont remember or assume have changed, so id appreciate help answering any of the below when first configuring new cisco equipment, do you still access it via serial port? is there some special name for a usbserial port adapter? in a pc environment, what software do i use to access the cli on a cisco switch? what are the three most significant change to enterprise networking in the last decade? what else should i have asked about? || its just a new cable type, easier to use than the old rs232 cable. i use securecrt for cli access, but there are loads, putty is free. networking is still all the layers it was, still all the same protocols. port speeds have increased dramatically, and weve got way more high speed ports. firewalls can inspect and block way more than ever before. the cloud is very popular, as is automation. || for the most part things are similar. you can use user guides that will be your best friend. things youll need is an ethernet cable, and a serial cable. i wave a serial. i personally like using securecrt, but im sure you have used putty, you can still use that if you want || the compact cisco switches 9200 now exclusively use micro usb. all others use the traditional rollover cable. all of the 9000 series cisco switches now have a management port in its own mgmtvrf just like the 3850s had thats handy for provisioning. autoinstall still works, so that hasnt changed, but now ztp allows you to run a python script within a guest shell to dynamically configure a device. its pretty slick. sdwan was around 10 yrs ago, and still is. cisco changed their automation platforms, while i havent used nso, catalyst center dna center, which is ciscos switch and ap management solution, is expensive and not great to work with. if you can do things with it programmatically, then its ok, if youre clicking buttons then i dont think it saves you time. cisco licensing has gotten very expensive. theyre done selling ios switches, so their current cheapest model is the fixed chassis 9200l. you have to buy a dna subscription when you purchase it, but you dont have to renew. there are licensing levels too. the asr is still around, albeit in smaller packages now, they run the same iosxe as the catalyst line, but its not really the same. netconf restconf can now be used to configurevalidate state on the 9k catalyst switches. iosxe, and many of the cisco competitors, now support streaming telemetry. basically a logging device can subscribe to data from the switch, and you build pretty dashboards and alarms when something is out of spec. release notes are more important than ever, now that switches are capable of running more services, which means more bugsvulnerabilities. its still a fun job. welcome back."
installing netdata for network tracking,"i have been working on this lab in ine for the ccnp encore and i can get everything to work no problem but one thing struck me that i dont quiet understand. this is the image of the topology when we redistribute the eigrp 100 routes in bgp and the routes are installed into r3s rib i can reach the next hop for r2 which is the router that redistributes the eigrp routes into bgp but i cannot reach the destination of the route install. for example one of the routes redistributed is in the trace route i can reach the r2 router but fails after i could not understand why that is the case. i thought once r3 reaches the next hope r2 would know how to send that traffic to r1s loopback considering it has a route to reach it in its rib. this is the lab in question if anyone uses ine || maybe you have forgotten to redistribute bgp into eigrp 100. || when r2 is redistributing the eigrp routes into bgp, it will advertise it to r3 unless if you have a routemap that prevents it to be advertised. do you have a routemap? the route for 140.0.1.1 must be presented in r3 routing table, otherwise, r3 will have no idea how to reach it. it is not enough for only r2 to know how to reach 140.0.1.1. can you show the output of r3 routing table? do a show ip bgp 140.0.1.0"
installing netdata for network tracking,"hey everyone, im a network admin for a school district and we have started installing ip intercom systems and using more and more airplay style devices. this means that i want to start managing multicasting more on our network. ive not had to mess with igmp snooping or pim before and am trying to find some good documentation and guides on how to set this up. our district is a ring network with ruckus icx 8200 switches running out buildings and a cisco nexus 9000 series as our core switch. everything later 3 is handled on our nexus. does anyone have any documentation or guides on how to set up igmp snooping and pim on this kind of network. my hope is for multicasting traffic to be routed to the nexus to then go to its destination instead of being broadcast across the vlan like normal. im assuming pim would be enabled on the nexus with an interface in each vlan and the ruckus switches would have igmp snooping turned on. though idk if theyd be set to passive or active with a querier ip. please let me know if im also misunderstanding something as ive had to try and learn a lot about this in a short time. || conceptually igmpv3mldv2 snooping on the l2 switches and aps if they have the feature. pimsm would run on the layer 3 cisco switch on every layer 3 subinterface vlan. ive never configured pim on cisco myself, but this should help you"
installing netdata for network tracking,"the title states our issues unfortunately. our county has installed fiber and is due to be activated this upcoming week. we were told by the installers that our current infrastructure is not up to the task of delivering the higher speed to our patron computers. the current system was installed 14 years ago and consists of a cisco sg20050 fifty port gigabit smart switch. our existing cable is cat 5 not even 5e and is currently functional for 15 desktops. our security system is an old qsee standalone recorder and has its own poe for the cameras. all we do is access the footage through our network. so in my research i do not believe we need to rewire the cameras. during my research i am now fairly confident that if we buy cat 6 cable and attach male ends, that i can run the cable myself from the switch to the patrons and staff computers. however i do have some questions for the pros regarding a direction to go. 1. our existing cat 5 does have lines running around the library to four port junction boxes spread out for patron access. i believe we could eliminate those junction boxes in the library due to the fact wifi is more common now than 15ish years ago. honestly in the 4 years i have been here i have never seen anyone connect a cable to any provided ports. if eliminating the ports are a go ahead, then my guess is that we wont need a 50 port switch and we can get something smaller and cheaper. 2. the fiber internet we are due to get will start off as 1 gbps and eventually go up to 10 gbps. so the powers that be tell us is cat 6 adequate to handle the future speed or should i choose cat 6a or even cat 7, 8? 3. i doubt that the 15 year old switch is secure so i am asking of the experts here to please recommend a new switch that is both secure and is inexpensive that would work for us here? 4. i should mention that we have a tplink archer ax4400 to provide wireless access. would that be enough or should we get something better? thank you from myself and the library staff to anyone who can offer us advice. edit i just received word that after buying the cable and ends, we could swing 1000 to 1200 for a quality switch. || i think you could do the switch upgrade later or never. 1gbps for even 100 users is enough to support most typical usage like streaming, video calling, and web browsing. waiting another year or two would mean better availability for 2.55gbps switching solutions. i think thats what you want here, but its more feel good than practical impact on user experience. focus on reliable mbps of throughput not top speed as thats what your patrons really need. a solid 50mbps will enable 99 of what is possible on the internet. || for funding, are you aware of erate? it is a program where the feds cover 80 of cost for network equipment and infrastructure that provides internet access to the public this includes installing ethernet in the walls. it is primarily for schools but libraries can also take advantage of the funding. || so youve got a 50port gigabit switch. and 15 endpoints. and since you now just have got fiber, those 15 endpoints are not connected adequately anymore? do those 15 endpoints have a 1gbps link each? quick summary youre fine. cat 5 is fine. like, perfectly fine. may i ask, what actual problem are you trying to solve?"
installing netdata for network tracking,"i work for a live events organisation and weve been tasked with deploying 300 controllable fixtures across a 3km outdoor site. usually these are controlled by dmx, cat6, or fibre but all of these become unfeasible at this scale as they are either too far for copper cables too expensive and risky to run fibre challenging to keep safe and out of the way of the general public were on the hunt for a solution that we could deploy across different sites and allows us to create 12 control hubs, all lniked back to a central router where the main controller would live. we functionally need to link 12 computers wirelessly across the 3km site. weve looked into wans, but they require interfacing with the service providers and seem to be fixed locations which is a high cost investment for a temporary installation. wlans would suit the setup, but are limited in range, except for maybe the unifi nanobeams. anyone had experience in something similar? any advice would be hugely appreciated. nb my networking experience is limited to events world, so while we often run managed networks, wireless is somewhat outside our scope. || armored fiber. anything else is a recipe for disaster, especially wifi, especially in a venue with every device in everyones pocket trying to use wifi. now, if you want ethernet over copper over long distances, you have the option of using vdsl2 bridges. i have them out in the field for dmarc extensions and they work great. || when you say fixtures, i assume youre talking about dmx lighting fixtures? i hope that youre not trying to run the actual dmx data wirelessly. to my knowledge, dmx over ethernet is not particularly faulttolerant to wireless systems and will likely get very unhappy very quickly. will each computer connected to a set of fixtures be running the lighting control software locally and youll just be remoting into the pc? if so, thatll probably work fine. dont do something like put a bunch of consoles in session together. protocols like manet tend to slow down the whole session to the slowest node which is bound to cause issues. || the people here who are actually suggesting wireless here are fucking nuts. you do live events, which i assume you mean lots of people. this means lots of devices and interference. they will immediately take over all the wifi channels by connecting to regular facilities wifi, which means your nanobeams will be fighting for channels. the only way you could maybe pull off wireless is if you have a standard it rider you send out to facilities ahead of time and have them block off a range of wifi channels for you. realistically, you just want fiber or ethernet over power. you are already running high voltage power cables to all of your lighting arrays, i assume 110 or 220v is supplied to the lighting racks. you could use powerline ethernet devices which send rf signals over the high voltage lines for point to point ethernet instead of wifi point to point. this will be an order of magnitude more reliable than any wireless solution and will not have interference or contention. alternatively... just do it right. get singlestrand armored singlemode fiber and bidi transceivers. you can buy a simplex os2 patch cable for ultra cheap and just consider it a throw away consumable for each event."
installing netdata for network tracking,"hi, i work for an msp and we have a potential new client asking for a solution to add a firewall router in a box outside in quebec 30 degrees celsius to 35 degrees celsius and i have never done that kind of thing. the client is an ev charger provider and this box controls the ev charging stations. they are currently using 3g and they are told that 3g will get removed in the next year or so. their current devices have home made programming inside and they do not want to discard it. so they want to add a router firewall to connect a couple of devices inside that pvc box which is outside on a building wall. they will add a new device to connect to 4g and this device needs to be connected to the current device which did 3g and the building network communication of some kind. so the new router firewall will act like a switch but will control trafic from the old 3g device to the building and viceversa we had our primary meeting today and i will get more details next week but i wanted to know if anyone here has ever had to install a router firewall in an outside environnement and if so, what did you use? thx edit april 15th thanks to everyone for all the great answers. we proposed a mikrotik hex refresh to our client to test and if all goes well, we will buy about 3040 more of these and replicate the settings using script i imagine that must work. cant wait to play with it !! || you are looking for a rugged router. cisco has the ir1101. || alot of mikrotikgear is rated 40 to 70. for example rb5009 or hex. || there are vendors who make rugged versions of networking equipment. we have several fortigate 70g models deployed on mining facilities throughout canada. operating temps are 40c to 70c and even have sim card slots."
installing netdata for network tracking,"simply put we have multiple, occasional projects where our customers need to send us tbs of data from across the us, or the world. time and again, the realworld transfer speeds are a fraction of the isps rated bandwidth. case in point, our l.a. office and a nyc client. we both have 1gbps fiber dia, but we can never get more than 350mbps between the sites. we ruled out the usual suspects no competing traffic at either site and we use an optimized protocol signiant, an enterprise udpbased product which maximizes the available pipe. not ftp, scp, etc. is the likely cause stingy peering agreements in the middle of the path? even a speedtest.net to their ny isp returns 480mbps. the question is how can i improve matters? with unlimited budget, id lease an mpls line between the nearest pops, as well as local loops, and enjoy line rate speed. but we dont have that kind of money. lease ip transit services from hurricane and the like id still need colo servers at the pops to at least roll out vpn, and hire a network engineer to configure it all. our small shop isnt at that level. furthermore, these projects last 110 weeks, never at the same location. isp salespeople get upset when you want mpls for a 2week contract term. hence looking for payasyougo solutions. which brings us to wanaas or sdwanaas paying a company that basically already does the above. i envision renting a box, or simply installing udp vpn software at either site, which connects to their nearby edge, preferably at the same location as the isps co to leverage as much isp bandwidth as possible and then forwards our special traffic over sufficientlyprovisioned tier 1 ip transit and repeat the process on the other end. but a solution based on cdn, caching server, or proxy servers could work too. am i on the right track here? do you know any vendors whod be relevant for these needs? || sounds like there is something wrong with the 10g ip transit you have. why not move to another provider? you should be able to get close to max line rate with the right transfer protocols. || i had to look up signiant. looks neat, i hope it works for you although it sounds like it may not be working correctly. i would reach out to them by opening a support case. they should have the experience and tooling available to quickly analyze and diagnose issues like this. your post has a lot to unpack. there are lots of potential solutions im sure many of the smart people here can cook up for you using a mixture of colocation and sdwan. id like to focus on the math and time side of things. you have stated 1gbps links on either end. assuming no contention and using tcp even though your signiant protocol utilizes udp you have a theoretical goodput using tcp of 118.4 mbs thats 118mb worth of payload data persecond not mbps. at that rate it would take 2.35hours to transfer 1tb of payload data. this is rough napkin math using tcp for transport and not taking into account latency. now because udp typically allows larger perpacket payloads because of the smaller header size and is not sensitive to latency as it doesnt have to wait for acknowledgements we can assume transferring over udp should be even faster. without knowing how signiant reacts to congestion or latency i cannot say if it truly would be faster. now, speedtest afaik still uses tcp, and is a shared service so not sure we can take that into account when calculating udp file transfers. since it sounds like you might control both ends perhaps running iperf3 could be the next step in figuring out if you truly have 1gbps available endtoend. simple enough test that could tell a lot. good luck. i hope you update your post if an actual problem is found. sounds like a fun mystery. cheers! || have a look at pepelink maybe? or, use a sync app that utilises the torrent protocol for transferring data. torrents are great at moving large amounts data."
installing netdata for network tracking,"hello everyone, i have two aging hp 8212zl switches that are being replaced later in 2025. i recently discovered that poe redundancy is not configured on these switches. reviewing the poweroverethernet redundancy command, i just wanted to confirm if i am understanding this properly core show poweroverethernet status and counters system power status prestandard detect off system power status no redundancy poe power status no redundancy chassis poweroverethernet total available power 1200 w total failover power 900 w total redundancy power 0 w total used power 183 w 6w total remaining power 1017 w internal power 1 300wpoe connected. 2 300wpoe connected. 3 300wpoe connected. 4 300wpoe connected. external power eps1 not connected. eps2 not connected. with my core output showing above, if i enable n1, i could have 2 power supplies fail total? with the full command, my total available power is 1200w, so half of that would be reserved for redundancy 600w. as i am using only about 183w, this would leave me about 417w of remaining power. am i understanding this correctly? i have been crawling through our network and locating devices that have been misconfigured or without spare psu installed. we had a failure a few weeks ago in a zl chassis that only had 2 power supplies and it caused half of the switch to function. i am trying to prevent that with added psu and redundancy configuration. || "
installing netdata for network tracking,"im currently working with a hotel to restructure their cabling and network infrastructure. due to how the original cabling was done during construction, most of the access switches are installed inside recessed wall enclosures located along the corridor walls of each floor behind small access panels you can open. additionally, a few switches are placed in the plenum space above certain room doors, mixed in with hvac stuff. redesigning or relocating these switches isnt an option, as the hotel owner is unwilling to tear down walls or do any structural remodeling for this project. heres my concern some of these access switches are layer 2 managed switches, with their ui accessible via the management vlan. both the management and guest vlans are tagged on the trunk link that connects the distribution switch to these access switches. in a hypothetical yet totally possible scenario, a guest could bring in their own managed switch, gain access to the plenum space, and swap out one of the access switches. if they manage to determine the vlan id for the management vlan, they could potentially access the entire fleet of switches using that vlan. if theres any vulnerability such as a login bypass this could lead to a major security risk. while this scenario is unlikely, its still possible. is there a way to prevent this? specifically, is there any layer 2 protection i can implement on the distribution switch that would restrict access to switch management interfaces, even if someone manages to get onto the management vlan by replacing an access switch? i think this security concern could be quite common if youre working with existing establishments that have managed switches in unsecured physical locations. of course in a perfect world, all networking gears would get their little closet with a lock, but it is not the case in many places. edit i know on cisco switches you can configure a loopback interface and use it for management purpose, but the owners of most smallmiddle businesses arent willing to spend this kind of money. edit2 i am talking about rogue managed switches. its clear that things like dhcp snooping, root guard to protect stp topology, dont use vlan 1 ...etc should be done. but im talking about someone actually physically swap out your switch. || yeah, this is a valid concern, especially in places where the switches cant be locked up properly. but i think the bigger point here is that this is exactly why all your network management protocols should be encrypted. if youre using things like ssh instead of telnet, instead of and snmpv3 instead of the older versions, then even if someone gets onto the management vlan, theyre not going to get very far. i mean, think about it. this kind of risk isnt limited to a guest sneaking in a switch. back in the day, if you had leased lines or any kind of wan link between sites, someone could potentially tap that line and sniff traffic. thats not new. and thats why encrypted protocols became standard. its not just for end users or clientserver apps. its for network management too. so yeah, you want to keep vlans secure, but the focus should be making sure nobody can do anything useful even if they get onto the vlan. encrypt your management traffic, use proper authentication, and youre already covering the most critical part. || definitely an x y problem. youre overthinking it. a physical switch gives nothing away if configured correctly, except down time. || lock down access to the switches from trusted subnets with acls. use encrypted methods to connect like sshtls. use strong passwords. the potential risks of someone getting physical access to a network switch are not unique to your situation. document and make sure the business is aware of the physical vulnerability of the switches to cya. when they say they wont fix that because it will cost 500k or whatever, you accept that and do your best to ensure that physical access wont allow an attacker to get any further. then you simply live with the risk."
