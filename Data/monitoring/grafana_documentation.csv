Prometheus data source

Prometheus is an open-source database that uses a telemetry collector agent to scrape and store metrics used for monitoring and alerting. If you are just getting started with Prometheus, seeWhat is Prometheus?.

Grafana provides native support for Prometheus.
For instructions on downloading Prometheus seeGet started with Grafana and Prometheus.

For instructions on how to add a data source to Grafana, refer to theadministration documentation.
Only users with the organizationadministratorrole can add data sources and edit existing data sources.
Administrators can alsoconfigure the data source via YAMLwith Grafana’s provisioning system.

Once you’ve added the Prometheus data source, you canconfigure itso that your Grafana instance’s users can create queries in itsquery editorwhen theybuild dashboards, useExplore, andannotate visualizations.

The following guides will help you get started with the Prometheus data source:

Prometheus API

The Prometheus data source also works with other projects that implement thePrometheus querying API.

For more information on how to query other Prometheus-compatible projects from Grafana, refer to the specific project’s documentation:

Provision the data source

You can define and configure the data source in YAML files as part of Grafana’s provisioning system.
For more information about provisioning, and for available configuration options, refer toProvisioning Grafana.

Note

Once you have provisioned a data source you cannot edit it.

Provisioning example

apiVersion: 1

datasources:
  - name: Prometheus
    type: prometheus
    access: proxy
    # Access mode - proxy (server in the UI) or direct (browser in the UI).
    url: http://localhost:9090
    jsonData:
      httpMethod: POST
      manageAlerts: true
      prometheusType: Prometheus
      prometheusVersion: 2.44.0
      cacheLevel: 'High'
      disableRecordingRules: false
      incrementalQueryOverlapWindow: 10m
      exemplarTraceIdDestinations:
        # Field with internal link pointing to data source in Grafana.
        # datasourceUid value can be anything, but it should be unique across all defined data source uids.
        - datasourceUid: my_jaeger_uid
          name: traceID

        # Field with external link.
        - name: traceID
          url: 'http://localhost:3000/explore?orgId=1&left=%5B%22now-1h%22,%22now%22,%22Jaeger%22,%7B%22query%22:%22$${__value.raw}%22%7D%5D'

View Grafana metrics with Prometheus

Grafana exposes metrics for Prometheus on the/metricsendpoint.
We also bundle a dashboard within Grafana so you can start viewing your metrics faster.

To import the bundled dashboard:

Navigate to the data source’sconfiguration page.

Select theDashboardstab.

This displays dashboards for Grafana and Prometheus.

SelectImportfor the dashboard to import.

For details about these metrics, refer toInternal Grafana metrics.

Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus

The Prometheus data source with Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is deprecated. Please use theAmazon Managed service for Prometheus data source. Migrations steps are detailed in the link.

Azure authentication settings

The Prometheus data source works with Azure authentication. To configure Azure authentication seeConfigure Azure Active Directory (AD) authentication.

In Grafana Enterprise, update the .ini configuration file:Configure Grafana. Depending on your setup, the .ini file is locatedhere.
Add the following setting in the[auth]section :

[auth]
azure_auth_enabled = true

Note

If you are using Azure authentication settings do not enableForward OAuth identity. Both use the same HTTP authorization headers. Azure settings will get overwritten by the Oauth token.

Exemplars

Exemplars associate higher-cardinality metadata from a specific event with traditional time series data. SeeIntroduction to exemplarsin Prometheus documentation for detailed information on how they work.

Note

Available in Prometheus v2.26 and higher with Grafana v7.4 and higher.

Grafana can show exemplars data alongside a metric both in Explore and in Dashboards.

See the Exemplars section inConfigure Prometheus data source.

Incremental dashboard queries (beta)

As of Grafana 10, the Prometheus data source can be configured to query live dashboards incrementally, instead of re-querying the entire duration on each dashboard refresh.

This can be toggled on or off in the data source configuration or provisioning file (underincrementalQueryingin jsonData).
Additionally, the amount of overlap between incremental queries can be configured using theincrementalQueryOverlapWindowjsonData field, the default value is10m(10 minutes).

Increasing the duration of theincrementalQueryOverlapWindowwill increase the size of every incremental query, but might be helpful for instances that have inconsistent results for recent data.

Recording Rules (beta)

The Prometheus data source can be configured to disable recording rules under the data source configuration or provisioning file (underdisableRecordingRulesin jsonData).
