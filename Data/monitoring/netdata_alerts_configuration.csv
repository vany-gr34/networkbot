netdata alerts configuration,"i am looking to upgrade hardware for metroregional wan network hub sites, and want to provide hardware redundancy. this wan serves a geodiverse dual core 911 call handling system, where each of 2 hub sites has single links dark fiberlayer2 leased link or lte modem tunneled to the psap remote sites. the hardware i inherited consists of single layer3 switches c9200cx at each hub site, with eigrp handling routing, and hsrp providing gateway redundancy between the 2 hub sites. the racks also contain a cold spare, older model, not up to date config. i have purchased 2 stacks of 2 c9300 switches to replace them, and i want to have 1 of each stack as active and one as standby, with identical interface configurations on each. since i am limited to having 1 remote site wan link for each hub site 1 dark fiber or cradle point serving each remote i would have to manually move cablessfps from one switch to the next in event of hardware failure, but i want to make sure that the standby router is configured and ready to rock should that be necessary, and i want to make sure that any config tweaks on the active are automatically propagated to the standby. since only one of each pair will be connected to the wan links, i dont really need millisecond failover from sso, or continuous forwarding from nsf or graceful restart routing stability, since any hardware failure would require physical intervention for link migration, and i want eigrp to route around the failure. i just want the peace of mind that should something happen, ive got a fully configured and booted spare right there in the rack below the failed device, and all that is required for bringing it online is a 1 for 1 move of each wan link. and a bonus question since this is an airgapped network, how would you handle alerting for failure states? || id have more piece of mind with an easy to use backup system and then some spares of the exact model in use, so i can just copy it over and roll. || you have dark fiber, like a pair of strands? swap to bidi optics and you turn those two strands into two links. doesnt protect against a fiber cut, but you can get hardware redundancy at each site which helps quite a bit."
netdata alerts configuration,"id like to move off solarwinds, but some of the things weve setup on there seem like theyd be difficult to replicate. im curious if anyone knows of monitoring products that may be able to replicate these. this includes 1 custom alert triggers with device variables ie. send an email to devices snmpcontact with device hostname included in the email and use regex to add readable log to body. 2 pictures i integrated device photos into the location and node pages. we have pictures of every rack and network device wed like to utilize. 3 configuration device backups and device changes. we push out changes and generate new device configs with ncm templates. 4 endpoint search able to search mac and port descriptions to find connected endpoints. || librenms netboxnautobot oxidized. also a linux box and something like a gitlab server to store your code in. || do you want them all in a single application? if youre ok with more than one app, for 3 theres rancid, unimus, rconfig and another that the name escapes me. for 4 netdisco is awesome. i use it all the time. makes finding where a device is connected from an ip or mac really easy. || single application for this will be hard. if you want to go with 2, will do 1,2,4 and for 3. both also crossintegrate really nicely. you can sync your inventory from netxms into unimus, so you dont need to manage it in 2 places. add a device to netxms, unimus will sync it and start managing its config, generating diffs and change notifications, etc. automatically. you can also have monitoring for unimus in netxms. for failed backups, last change overview, or even trigger config pushes in unimus from netxms. its a really nice stack for nms and ncm. || zabbix can monitor devices and send alerts. netdisco for searching devices. || ive moved around quite a bit, and the stack ive been happiest with is netbox but only for the rackspace bit. librenms dont really like it, but have found nothing better unimus i love this product for other features you didnt mention that i generally consider part of the network management stack, i still havent found one i love for ipam so ill just use netbox for that, but honestly dont love it. for logging i got so frustrated with the landscape that i ended up building my own solution. || lol did you know about the private equity buyout before posting this? || great timing || can replicate most of this for you. i wanted to ask my colleague who has worked at solarwinds, auvik and now domotz as a product manager but she is on holidays atm. 1 many custom alert triggers, variables and scripting options virtually infinite possibilities 2 we do have network topology mapping which you can export for use in visio. im inquiring about the use of pictures internally, you can add custom notes but i dont believe directly in the software. ill brb with the official answer on pictures! 3 we have remote config management features including remote device configmanagementbackup security alerts and changelog. 4 very powerful searchoranization functionalities. totally free, no cc. and then pricing options from 1.50device. happy to help here or on rdomotz if you have any questions. || just stay away from logicmonitor. it sucks. its obvious lm havent put any money into development in a very long time. the product has remained stagnant and the support sucks. lm promised all these additional features and they simply havent delivered. || solarwinds getting sold to private equity nows probably the time start moving away. || i moved off solar water nds back when they had their supply chain hack. ended up setting up librenms and oxidized as a temp solution. still using 5 years later. added elastiflow for netflow monitoring. only thing you are looking for that i dont have is the endpoint search. netdisco should cover that. i do custom templates for my alerts. i dont know how to do the linked photo thing but i have ideas ona way to do it. || what network hardware are you using? || observium is another option to look into as well || 2 pictures i integrated device photos into the location and node pages. we have pictures of every rack and network device wed like to utilize. how did you do this? || been using nectus for over a year and love it."
netdata alerts configuration,"edit i appear to have solved it. as it was our voip vlan, i assume the draytek vigor 2862 device we have sitting in between the wan and core was assuming the querier. after going scorched earth and untagging all ports on the vlan and bringing everything back up piece by piece but leaving the draytek port til last, the core switch is now staying as the querier and the alerts are gone! this would explain why disabling the vlans igmp on all switches didnt fix it as the querier was sitting above the core. still unsure how it was becoming elected with a higher ip though... in my defence, i inherited this environment and theres no documentation on who manages or owns the draytek lol. weve never touched it. im pretty sure its to become obsolete in our env. in the next 6 months anyway. if you have a better understanding, please reply, i would love to learn more about this and how i could have found the solution quicker. last and final edit i now realize that a querier port was set on the vlan, which was the port the draytek was plugged in to. if i understood igmp a little more i may have noticed that, however now that the core is the querier, there is no port set. hopefully this helps somebody in the future! no need to update imgp version just yet lol. original post i noticed there was a whole bunch of alerts appearing within the log relating to igmpv3 queries received and the device being configured for igmpv2 after an update to the latest firmware of our core switch yesterday. the config is exactly the same and nothing has changed in that sense, but this is what is logged every 1m 25 seconds across all switches received igmpv3 query from 10.41.211.2 when the device is configured for igmpv2. we have igmp enabled on this vlan and most all others too. no ip igmp querier is set in configs for all other edge switches for this vlan and the vlan gateway 10.41.211.1 is seemingly automatically set as the query address on the core when disablereenabled. when i check the edge devices via cli and use ip igmp vlan xxx config, it looks as though even though no ip igmp querier is set, it has a query address 10.41.211.2. then, when i run the command again it seems to disable the query address , but if i then check the vlans igmp config again, its running again only seconds later. i have tried to update the igmp version using the cli language found in the manuals hp pdfs, but it doesnt recognize it. im not super educated when it comes to networking protocols other than a little more than the basics so its really got me stumped. google doesnt seem to have much in the way of specific or similar info in regard to this alert apart from one poster in 2023, with the same switch and problem... but typically it doesnt look like he found or posted an answer. the next goal after firmware updates was to sort out the sntp timesync so that the date and times on our switches were correct and current to help with extra clarity when troubleshooting. but this error has taken a big hot steamy load right on top of those hopes and dreams lol. we do have a support contract with an msp for level 3, but weve got some big projects planned for this year which will eat up most of the contracted engineer time, so im hoping to be able to get this resolved myself. any help is massively appreciated! edit to add to this, i just disabled igmp for all switches and reenabled it on the core switch. the error is still occurring. || hi there, i noticed that you mentioned trying to update your igmp version but were unsuccessful. what version are you running? if you issue the command igmp lookupmode ip at the global configuration level, you should then be able to drill down to a vlan and then enter ip igmp version 3. just to clarify, do you want or to be your igmp querier? for example, if i was configuring a new switch for igmpv3 with the querier not being on the switch then i would type switch1config igmp lookupmode ip switch1vlan100 name networkname switch1vlan100 tagged f24 switch1vlan100 no ip address switch1vlan100 ip igmp switch1vlan100 ip igmp version 3 switch1vlan100 no ip igmp querier then if i do show ip igmp vlan id 100 vlan name networkname igmp version 3 querier address querier configured on my upstream router, or for you, your core switch querier port f24 querier uptime 0d 0h 24m 9s querier expiration time 0h 1m 11s active group addresses tracking vers mode uptime expires"
netdata alerts configuration,"update after lots of troubleshooting and help from hpe other sources, turns out this is a software bug in the 6200 series. i got hold of some 6300fs for testing purposes and everything works exactly as it should. theres an hpe internal engineering ticket thats been raised to find out why the 6200fs arent working quite right, but as far as im concerned thats hpes problem now. thanks for the help everyone! im setting up a poc for some new crestrondante av gear, and im fumbling my way through trying to get it to work im not an igmp guy vendors are of little help, theyre av guys and their advice is to just buy a netgear they mean the ones with igmpplus fwiw. the poc gear includes 2x 6200fs, 2x 8360s for a vsx core, but am currently just trying to get it working on one of the 6200fs. so far, its sortofworking. vendor says they should be seeing 14 streams im seeing 9 on the aruba, their dante controller is showing 2, and those are constant. if they pair 2 aes67 devices on their netgear switch, move the cables to the aruba, the pairing and stream stays active for a minute or so, then pairing and the stream disappear. the 6200f has elected itself as querier, the streams are ticking over with packet counts, everything seems ok as best i can tell. relevant config vlan 1802 ip igmp snooping enable ip igmp snooping version 2 interface lag 1 shutdown currently shut to rule out the vsx as potential issue no routing vlan trunk native 1 tag vlan trunk allowed 1,1802 lacp mode active qos trust dscp interface 11x all ints configured the same no shutdown no routing vlan access 1802 qos trust dscp spanningtree porttype adminedge ip igmp snooping fastleave vlan 1802 interface vlan 1802 ip address ip igmp enable ip igmp version 2 ip igmp querierwaittime 125 ip igmp routeralertcheck enable ip igmp querymaxresponsetime 100 ip proxyarp ip igmp snooping fastlearn 1111148 ip igmp snooping fastlearn lag 1 ip igmp snooping filterunknownmcast ive reached the point where im just trying throwing whatever at the wall to see what sticks, so some of that config may not be necessary. i do have some classes setup to prioritize aes67 and can include if anyones interested, but im not yet at the point where im worried about packet drops. the vsx is setup to do an aes67 ptp profile, but having the ptp master present neither helps nor hinders. any tips on getting this gear working? good show commands to try? any thing in this config i should be addingremoving? all advicecritiqueslander is appreciated. || presumably you looked at dante networking guides by audinate? the rules have been written before everyone in av switched over to netgear and their one click and done profiles. also, try proav sub for more dante experience. || tried not using ptp? || we run a combined aes67 with crestron nvx av which means some the recommened settings conflict with each other. i can suggest 2 things but both are related to ptp. i have found some devices have trouble with ptp with igmp filterunknownmcast. so i exclude ptp from the filterunknownmcast. vlan 1802 ! ptp audio clock sync exclude from filter unknown multicast ip igmp snooping staticgroup 224.0.1.129 the other thing to try is the new ptp features in the cx switches. i have not had a chance to test this out yet. ptp profile aes67 enable clockstep onestep transportprotocol ipv4 mode transparent endtoend interface lag 1 ptp enable ptp vlan 1802 interface av edge ports qos trust dscp ptp enable ip igmp snooping fastleave vlan 1802 ip igmp snooping forcedfastleave vlan 1802 vlan access 1802"
netdata alerts configuration,"i have been doing some rd for several network monitoring agents, with snmp, api, updown alerting, and opensourcefree as requirements. we are mostly monitoring routers, switches, and wifi hence the snmpapi req. librenms, ptrg free tier, netdata, prometheus, grafana, uptime kuma, etc. they would be hosted on a small mini pc or firewall appliance running proxmox andor dockerportainer. sending alert emails out when the agent is online and the network is up is easy. however, if the locally hosted nms agent is offline, opensourcefree, and not tied to a paid cloud service, obviously it cant send an email alert out if it has no internet or is just down. has anyone sorted out how to send an alert email if the network agent are offline using any of these free tools? looking to keep this as free or cheap as possible, strong preference for cloud hosting a master nms agent that could report if the local nms agents are down, but a selfhosted web server is also an option. || for monitoringthemonitoring we use a simple dead mans switch system. we have a main prometheus per network that monitors other prometheus instances. in the main prometheus instance we have an always firing alert that is sent to an external cronstyle monitoring service. if that heartbeat fails, an alert is sent to our pagerduty oncall. any of these would work, in alphabetical order by domain, we use one of them. || essentially how do you monitor the monitor? i can only speak for prtg out of your list, as its the only one ive used recently. generally, if were not using the dedicated hosted solution we will have the core server located in a data centre. we then use remote probes on each site to monitor the local infrastructure. if an internet connection or vpn goes down, or if the remote probe stops, it will drop from the core and send an alert. || uptimerobot? i dont think youre going to find a distributed nms you can host for free. || we are mostly monitoring routers, switches, and wifi hence the snmpapi req. librenms, ptrg free tier, netdata, prometheus, grafana, uptime kuma, etc. side note, holy hell, you could easily simplify this stack. imo, prometheus locally, grafana cloud hosting for central data mangement. so much easier."
netdata alerts configuration,"hi! i have hparuba switches. we have two hp running irf. aruba 25402930 are connected using link aggregation and hp its bridge aggregation. so two 10g ports from aruba to are connected to two hp acting as one with irf and ports are bundled. i have similar configuration for some critical server that i have configure nic teaming on them and hp has bridge aggregation. i have two fortigates acting as activepassive and connected to these hp switches. i have vlan interfaces on fortigate and trunk vlans are on hp switch ports. this step is running from last two year or more. not much has been changed. only i add vlans to trunk. the last changed i did was 10 months ago when i moved the vlan interfaces to firewall. so all in all everything is working. the last change was done yesterday when i changed the unifi ap channels in the afternoon i saw few unifi ap were flapping like i got alert from our monitoring that they are offline, i checked the access switch which i saw some excessive broadcasts error and high collision or drop rate. this is pretty common error in aruba switches high collision or drop rate. excessive broadcasts were showing for trunk interfaces and only on one switch two access ports have the same message. these ports are connect to unifi ap. i checked on the core hp router but no error was triggered during the time where switch got these errors. i found log on hp switch which was after 18 mins of these broadcast error. port xge1026 of aggregation group bagg81 changed to the inactive state, because the aggregation configuration of its peer port is incorrect. this interface is bridge aggregation. i found message in the librenms state sensor ha sync status firewall1 has changed from 1 to in sync 1 i checked the logs on switches for excessive broadcasts and checked the first log instance of this error on all switches and then found one switch which got this message first. i looked into it but nothing special that can lead me to something. during the same time i lost connect to mgmt interface ip connectivity on our vmware server. so this happens for 3 mins and after that everything started working fine. no clue why this happened. checked the core hp router but nothing much on it like some stp or any other issue. writing this here in case someone can suggest to check more or guess what went wrong. thanks || are the unifi aps configured to do wireless backhaul? i think i remember seeing one time that when configured or allowed in the settings, sometimes they could create loops by creating wireless links to other aps even though the aps themselves had physical hardwire connections to the network. i guess if youre not using their mesh functionality, it might be worth trying to disable or not allow that in the ap settings. im not sure why it would be starting to happen now, but you mentioned changing ap channels on the unifi aps recently so maybe something goofy happened there with them? || this is pretty common error in aruba switches high collision or drop rate. no its not. theres most likely something wrong with your cabling || the aps seem to have connected to each other and caused a loop. i believe that the aps have a mesh mode, where they can connect to each other to have the second ap connect to the first one like an extender. you can look through your unifi settings and turn off any mesh settings between these 2 aps since they are both hardwired to the same switch."
netdata alerts configuration,"hi everyone, im a junior network admin, i dont have a lot of experience and im managing a smallmedium network of 40 pcs configured by the previous network admin. for some time in the lan subnet i noticed an unknown ip 192.168.0.10 i have take note of the ip of all devices in the network and this device in rotation has the mac address of other three pcs in the network. if all the 3 pcs are online i have a mac address duplicated the pc with the duplicate mac addr. doesnt have networking problems and works fine otherwise the unknown host will have the mac address of one of the three pcs that is offline. ive scanned the 192.168.0.10 address with nmap but it has all port filtered and i have no other info than the rotating mac address. all pcs are connected to two hp aruba 2530 48 port switches with stp configured. one of this switch has a warning alert on the port where is connected one of the three pcs i have mentioned above, the warning states port 11excessive undersizedgiant packets. see help. can be related to the issue? note in the network there are 5 unmanaged switches due to lack of ethernet wall ports, these can create datalink layer loops and cause my problem? i also suspect a problem with stp config so i rebooted the switches but nothing has changed. what can i also do to find the source of the issue? thanks for the help! update i disconnected all the three pcs and the ip 192.168.0.10 is now offline, as soon as i reconnect a pc this ip will return online with the same mac address of the pc that ive reconnected. i forgot to mention that one of the three pcs is connected under another one aruba 2530 managed switch 8p. this switch have a lot of errors like est enrollment with server failed because of cacerts curl error ill post the highlevel network diagram as soon as i can, at the moment i have only text config files of each network equipment and no graphical scheme ||  || sounds like a badly behaving dock, ive seen some similar sounding wonky stuff with those. especially offbrand ones. || please provide the highlevel network diagram. || remove the unmanaged switches after hours and see if the random device stays, if its all managed switches you can follow the mac address to a specific port. || youll know if you have loops when everything stops working. || you sure its not just 3 pcs with the same ip? || whats the makemodel of the unmanaged switches. its hard to believe, but there are still people making ethernet hubs out there. hub, not switches, definitely need to come out of the network. || the first thing is to do room mapping wall socket patchpanel switch then remove all unmanaged switches and deploy managed ones if you have such a small network, do a readdressing of the entire network to a new address, including vlans || 2 options simply apply mac address sticky to every interface, or go to the physical location and see for yourself. and ffs fight to get those unmanaged switches off the network. thats a nightmare. || mac computer randomly generating mac address, and using old arp entries to do it? or a loop. || this smells a bit like an sccm wake up proxy, a rather stupid invention out of redmond. || maybe you have stp problem but without a detailed diagram is hard to say, also, the only one device that i know that changes their mac address every a few minuteshours are samsung phones, it can be disabled on wifi settings, but never uses another device mac || if you know the port, go find the device, but based on this info, id look for a loop, i also saw that someone mentioned a docking station, id look there too. || maybe a laptop dock that multiple people use and its a bit wonky? the unmanaged switches do make things more difficult. you could have a loop somewhere. but also, i sometimes see unmanaged switches that have a loop control feature. a managed switch will see a mac address for the switch itself, and i could see a situation where a small time switch vendor made a weirdly functioning loop control that did weird stuff like that. but that would be a very weird situation if its happening. youre going to have to track down that cable run and see what all is on it to even have a starting point. || i havent dealt with aruba before but im certain they should have the ability to look at your macaddress tables. look at the table to see which interface these mac addresses are being learned on. im making some assumptions here since youre lacking some details. im assuming that the unmanaged switches are directly connected to your aruba switches instead of daisy chained together. once you look at mac address table you should be able to narrow down to which port on the aruba switch which is connected to the unmanaged switch that the device is connected to. from here you will have to disconnect and reconnect to find your device. if your unmanaged switches are daisy chained youre in some trouble. also this maybe a minor annoyance now, but you dont want a resource starvation issue with your dhcp server. if push comes to shove, you only have 40 computers that you may need to walk around to to get there mac addresses."
netdata alerts configuration,"hi everyone at rnetworking ! my first post here. short intro now we are using a elk stack for storing syslog messages from network devices. however im thinking of evolving things, in term of visualization, parsing, metrics and alerting for certain types of syslog messages. i want dashboards which will answer me questions of how muchmany configure your needs here, will display alerts triggered by some syslog messages ideally if those are recurring in a timespan like links flapping and also need a query instrument with full text search can you provide me some direction? what should i use? as i can see, lokigrafana suits the requirements? or do i need some sort of graylog prometheus? i dont think i need wazuh or utmstack, because i just need visualization, search and alerting. || in my current company we use 2 tools for networking monitoring. zabbix for alerting and graylog for datacollection. inside graylog you can make a dashboard with widgets that can show you the status of certain search patterns. check whenever you have a search query for the dashboarding, you can also use it for alerting. just check this out || i am currently working on the stack of grafana, prometheus, loki and the various exporters for prometheus. alerting not present yet, but would probably be fulfilled with alertmanager combined with something like oncall. this all combined with nautobot as a source of truth, source for the scraping and definitions. i love how that data of prometheus and loki can be combined in one dashboard. so seeing a drop in traffic along with the relevant syslog messages of a device. really curious about others their experiences. || do you need it to be opensource? i know of graylog, but it isnt as comprehensive as elk. we are using vsa x. its log monitoring is amazing and does most of what you are looking for. || i prefer observium or librenms for this. || i typically recommend streaming logs into something that can generate metrics for alerting. one good simple solution for this is you can create logs matchers that generate metrics. another way to go about this is to put this in your logs collection pipeline. if you replace the logstash in your elk stack with you can use the || victorialogs. it accepts syslog logs without the need of additional syslog server see and it provides alerting tools, which can be used for generating alerts from query results over logs see it also provides grafana plugin for building arbitrary dashboards from logs see || librenms syslog integration does this very well. || nmis9"
netdata alerts configuration,"hi, i work for a company that has hundreds of sites that have x2 cisco routers running each of them. these sites can typically be categorized as a store or distribution centre. we have a different configuration standard for stores and distribution centre types. one of the biggest issues our network team have always dealt with is keeping our objectgroup, access control lists, and more compliant for each site type. we currently use cisco prime for configuration deployment mainly and it really is just not cutting it for us anymore or ever did. we are looking into paid or free configuration compliance tools and would appreciate suggestions. the ideal configuration compliance tool in my mind will alert us and ideally auto remediate a site that has come out of compliance. i would be capable of building my own solution using ansible and raw code, but i think a supported product is better for the organisation instead of some code i have personally hacked together. i look forward to the suggestions. || netbox with the config compliance plugin. || the cisco catalyst center should be able to do what you are asking for, we are currently demoing it and plan to use it for our catalyst switches note this is only for catalyst switches and it supports routers too. || solarwinds ncm || besides open source solutions which were mentioned netboxnautobot, you can try manageengine opmanager it has a configuration pluginpart that can be used for what you want. it can be downloaded and installed on a windows pc for a proof of concept, if you like it then you can buy. i think the licensing is per device so might be expensive compared to open source. if thats the case see if some company in your area provides support for netboxnautobot might be cheaper in the long run. i think that solution tailormade for your use case will always be better, so no shame in paying some consulting to have somebody help you with it instead of shelling out on licensing for some enterprise software that might not do exactly what you want. the only solution i would skip 1000 is catalyst center, a lot of money for something so buggy. || nautobot and its golden configuration plugin fairly simple to get going, and can be quite powerful. || emmm, why you guys trust a plugin more than yourselves as a network engineer please? || automation, source of truth... audit..."
netdata alerts configuration,"hello, its late so i apologise in advanced if this might be a bit incoherent. in short, i look after quite a few disparate networks and ive never quite figured out a great solution for monitoring. at the minute, for my clients that opt in for it, each of their cellular routers is running a janky hacked together sdk for tailscale this then gets them inside of their own tailnet. inside of this tailnet is a prtg probe. from this probe, i can then reach their routers and alert when they go offline etc for what i need to achieve, this works great. the issue is, however, is for a few of our larger clients in which weve stepped inside the network more so and look after the switching and backbone connectivity. take for example a client of mine i setup their network with about 15 icx ruckus switches and 2030 ruckus aps these are all managed on smartzone so i dont really need to worry to much about this. the problem i have at the minute is my siklu backhaul. between some of the large external buildings, i configured and setup a ptmp network using siklu mmwave nodes and terminals and its honestly fantastic the trouble is, i havent quite nailed how to get this onto my prtg platform. its not, as far as i know, as open as my routers, in that, i cant side load tailscale onto it and give it an ip from the cgnat range and monitor it like i do the routers. the only idea i had was to setup a local node inside of the network and configure to talk to my core prtg platform in azure. unless, of course, theres an easier solution that i am clearly not seeing? || it always seems to come back to snmp in a multivendor world. snmp polling and traps will likely do the job. || something like auvik? youll be a machine at each site to deploy the agent on and youll need to configure snmp || hey there! i just wanted to chime in and say you can use domotz to deploy small probes into each layer 2 network. we are a vendoragnostic solution that can help you with 247 device monitoring through icmp, arp, snmp, ssh, rest api, and a lot of other proprietary and public protocols. we have an excellent device discovery engine, device monitoring, alerting, remote power management, remote access through secure tunnels without opening any ports on your gateway and firewall, public apis, custom scripting, etc. we offer an interactive network topology mapping to see on which port a specific device is plugged in on each switch. we do have a selfservice free trial, so you can give it a spin and see how we could help if there is anything particular you want to know about or features youre looking for, dont hesitate to ask me, as im on the domotz team."
