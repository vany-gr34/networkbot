predict failures in network devices,"if you were creating multiple points to point l2vpns on an mplssr network. what would you think your needed label depth would need? there are over 100 devices on your isis domain, all in your mpls network. from my understanding you dont need a label for each device using sr, you only need to know the labels for your l2vpn. is this correct? || 8 minimum, no exceptions, looking at you half ass merchant silicon fringe vendors and any vendors that are not implementing label recycling t label v label lu label networks grow and need to be regionalized, as bgpsr matures this afi may replace lu for the same purpose. tilfa labels assume 2 worst case as most vendors leverage node sids, however some do need a few more as they lean on node and adj sids. srte labels assume 26 depending on the usecase fat or entropy label future use as pcep matures further. fringe use cases around bgpepe and bgpcarcat i am yet to see control word counted as a label by any vendor so no worries there. also if the node does not have the ability to signal msd max label depth both in the igp and via bgpls to a controller let the vendors plm know and sideline them in the lab. || generally 3 is enough, transport service and an extra for bypass for frr depending on their implimentation. higher label stacks can occur when you are doing different types of nni with other mpls domains. || its been a while since i delved into segment routing, but the basicdefault label stack would consist of two labels, similar to regular ipmpls. the service label doing the vrfinstance segregation and the transport label. with sr tbe transport label by default is usually the global sid of the remote destination router. if you are trying to do complex traffic engineering or link selection then your stack would contain more segment labels on top identifying the sids for the linksdevices in the middle of the path. so by default, yes you only need the global sid of the remote router for tagging."
predict failures in network devices,"my company currently has a security device that sits inbetween our router and our isp. its basically a transparent firewall that will block traffic based on geographic location, security feeds, ports, and ip addresses etc. it reduces the overall load on our firewalls by a drastic amount and its an easy first stop block that i dont really have to think about much. its fantastic...when its working. unfortunately now, this appliance crashes constantly and the vendor cant figure it out. i am at my wits end with it as our internet completely goes down when this device stops working. im browsing around looking for security appliances that sit at the edge of a network that perform a similar function. im wondering if anyone else here uses a similar product described above? im tempted just to have my company buy another firewall i can throw on the edge to do the same thing but managing that is a bit more work than what is currently in place. || any modernappropriately sized firewall should be able to handle that without needing any help. its just another point of failure, as youre currently discovering. just get a single correctlysized box to it ideally an ha pair, but whatever. dont toss in another firewall in front of your firewall. || we just do that on the firewall itself. || if you still have another firewall inline and the vendor cant figure it out, i would be ripping it out immediately so you can stop the outages. if its just geolocationfeeds, and other misc ip blocks then even pfsense with pfblockerng could handle that."
predict failures in network devices,"ive got a small enterprise network i am deploying.. a pair of c9336cfx2e running nxos 10.35 in vpc domain. since this is for the enterprise not an msp, i really see no advantage to running multiple vrfs, my preference is to keep things simple... although i have gone wthe best practice of keeping the vpc peerkeepalive on the management vrf by itself. what i really want to talk about is all of these mentions of having dedicated layer2 and dedicated layer3 links. i much prefer to have a nice fat 400gig vpc peer link on which i have the peergateway, layer3 peerrouter, fastconvergence, and autorecovery features enabled. the use case is for hpc and vdi all deployed into a single cabinet with a pure storage with file services... were looking at omnissa for vdi. but getting back to having dedicated layer3 which is often cited as a best practice the only advantages i see are to prevent routing issues during potential misconfigurations, and potentially faster recovery in certain failure scenarios.. ignoring misconfigurations lets assume they wont happen changes will be very minimal once this is up and running what am i missing, why is it a bp to add dedicated layer3 links? i am going to be running ospf in the network core on the same switches that host the vpc domain... why cant i just let that all run over the same vpc peerlink? please tell me what im missing here... not to mention if you look at the table on this link there are asterisks and other symbols next to l2 link and l3 link for different topological routing adjacencies ie. future support may be limited with dedicated l2l3 links if the environment expands || love this, youre clearly thinking this through. im a var and heres kinda what ive seen from customers and cisco ses in similar vpc builds dedicated layer 3 links give you fault isolation. if your vpc peerlink gets congested, flaps, or hits errors, you dont want routing protocols or northsouth traffic tied up in that. vpc peerlinks are really meant for eastwest l2 traffic and vpc control plane sync. when you push routing adjacencies and l3 over them, especially with ospf, recovery behavior can get messy under failure conditions. ciscos own best practice is to keep the vpc peerlink clean, and use a separate routed link often via the same pair of switches, sure for l3 adjacencies like ospf or bgp. helps avoid weird dependencies during convergence events. your setup with 400g and all the vpc enhancements sounds solid. if your use case is predictable and failure domains are small, it may still work fine. but if you anticipate growth or changes vdi scaleout, separation is worth it. dm me if you need more helpsupport! || we just use a virtual l3 link using svis 30. you want l3 connectivity between the n9ks right? || maybe it was before being able to use layer3 peerrouter? im on a big peerlink vpc like your config and its fine with vpc, ospf, bgp, multicast and without peerrouter it wouldnt be possible or half the traffic would just black hole."
predict failures in network devices,"in most book and networking material there is always a mentionnof mtu. why do we care about mtu transmission size but we hardly hear of received size? what happens when received datagram size is large, how does a device even know received datagram is large? which also begs the question what is mtu really cause it is mostly defined by config on interface but what does it really represent? ps i know the consequences of having mtu mismatch or why we need to make sure packets have correct mtu along the path so dont peg your answer in that direction. || packets dont have an mtu, a packet must either fit in the mtu or be fragmented until the pieces fit. thats why mtu is the key thing in your question. || mtu is not payload, it is inherent to a link and the protocols used on it. to keep a coherent payload size across a network path you might account to different mtus, if things like gre, mpls, ppp are used across. || storage team checking in"
predict failures in network devices,"im sure this has been asked to death but i recently got a new backpack for work, one of the vendors my company partners with was giving them away as a gift meant for people on the network team. i had hoped that his backpack would come with inserts inside for network cables or something, but there doesnt appear to be anything in it. im pretty tired of having a mess of wires and devices all over my backpack especially because they vary in size so much whenever i actually need to grab something its kind of a nightmare. ive seen inserts online and ill probably buy one off amazon. but i was curious if anybody knows any other options. it seems like a lot of the inserts i seen online either are too small like for travel use during vacation, or too big practically like a briefcase, or the elastics for the wires to be rolled up into arent big enough to support any wires bigger than a small patch cable or something. || i swear by retractable cables. you can get them in all flavors, hdmi, usb, cat7 even. ive got two mesh pouches in my pack, one for nonnetwork retractables and another for networkonly. need a really long network cable? throw a coupler in there and make 2 cables into one. || ziplock bags. cheap, waterproof, available in many sizes and if i break one, nbd i have 50 more in a box at home. || i use travel packing pouches. every cable gets individual velcro and is then organized into either network, serial or power. for me this balances out the need for organization without going overboard."
predict failures in network devices,"hello i need recommendation for switch and router firewall combo or seperately for mobile broadcast solution that fit under 4u. the current design have 5 network. vlan 1 for internet, 2 for audio dante, 3 for video ndi, 4 for light artnet and 5 for remote control osc. 30 devices total, 8 spare is enough. each devices need to connect to each own category video devices to 3, speakers to 2, recorders to 5, etc but consoles need to connect to two network ex audio mixer to 2 and 5, light console to 4 and 5 with two cables and pcs need to connect to all network with single cable. this is not 247 scenario and the equipment must reboot fast because it will on and off multiple daily. the ip on each device must be predictable based on its hostname. uplink need to be connected directly to vlan 1 so that all pcs have internet and access uplink network. the other vlan must be isolated from each other and from uplink network. uplink will only give ip for vlan 1 and dhcp for rest vlan. the remain network must still work wether uplink is connected or not. is under 3k possible for this constraint? thanks || the netgear av line switches will fit your requirements."
predict failures in network devices,"essentially, im looking for a link aggregator to be the backbone of a disparate location. what i currently have is a spread out network in the same building. that building is a historic building, so ripandreplace with a single location is almost entirely out of the question primarily for budgetary reasons. there are currently six switches spread across four floors, each with a single fiber connection back to the current distribution switch in the datacenter. what i want to do is change the current connection back to the datacenter into a routed connection, instead of a switched one, using a pair of 10gig fiber connections. then, i want to connect two fiber connections to each of the switches behind that unit. normally, id be looking at something like a cisco 9500 to accomplish this, but, for budgetary reasons, thats not possible. i considered something like a cisco cbs350, but that doesnt appear to have the ability to do dynamic routing protocols, static only. im not married to cisco as vendor, so, send me some suggestions on devices i could use to accomplish this. also worth noting is one of the six switches is superfluous and will be removed as part of this project. || i dont have any experience with them, but fs.com may have some models that fit your needs. || not totally clear on the topologyrequirements you need 8x sfp ports on a switch that can do dynamic routing? theres an aruba cx 6300 with 24p sfp that can do ospf and bgp for like 9500 usd with no licensing required looks like the ex440024x will be a similar price. if youre okay with zero extra ports, ex410024t have 8x sfp for way, way less, like a couple thousand. you need to buy a license for ospfbgp on these || cisco catalyst c9300x12y will meet your requirements."
predict failures in network devices,"hey everyone, im a network admin for a school district and we have started installing ip intercom systems and using more and more airplay style devices. this means that i want to start managing multicasting more on our network. ive not had to mess with igmp snooping or pim before and am trying to find some good documentation and guides on how to set this up. our district is a ring network with ruckus icx 8200 switches running out buildings and a cisco nexus 9000 series as our core switch. everything later 3 is handled on our nexus. does anyone have any documentation or guides on how to set up igmp snooping and pim on this kind of network. my hope is for multicasting traffic to be routed to the nexus to then go to its destination instead of being broadcast across the vlan like normal. im assuming pim would be enabled on the nexus with an interface in each vlan and the ruckus switches would have igmp snooping turned on. though idk if theyd be set to passive or active with a querier ip. please let me know if im also misunderstanding something as ive had to try and learn a lot about this in a short time. || conceptually igmpv3mldv2 snooping on the l2 switches and aps if they have the feature. pimsm would run on the layer 3 cisco switch on every layer 3 subinterface vlan. ive never configured pim on cisco myself, but this should help you"
predict failures in network devices,"so i have two windows 11 computers on two separate networks in separate buildings miles apart. no vpn. today i cant access any local ip addresses from either location. i can access them from linux using firefox. so the services are up. chrome, firefox, and edge all time out from the windows boxes. disabling the firewall does not help. ive been using google for hours to hunt possible issuesfixed. no help. im not new. ive got 30 years of solid semi skilled experience. anyone seen this before or have a clue i can borrow? edit i solved it by disabling wireguard on my device. again, nothing has changed on my servers or my devices. but for some reason wireguard started hijacking my local dns. this is not a fix but at least i found the issue. thanks for all the help! || find out where in the traffic path the packets get stuck. || kind of sounds like a dns issue or routing issue. are timeouts the only error message?"
predict failures in network devices,"i have a dell n2224x switch and for the life of me cannot figure out what might be disallowing traffic originating from certain vlans to hit the management ip. switch ip vlan 10 host 1 ip vlan 40 host 2 ip vlan 20 some scenarios i can pingssh to the switch ip from host 2 but not host 1. i can pingssh to other devices in vlan 10 from host 1, but not the switch itself. all vlans have been created on the switch i can pingssh to a nondell switch ip that is connected via a trunk interface on the dell. im kinda stumped on what might be going on here. hopefully i have provided enough context for some things to check. thank you for your time. edit this has been solved. i changed the unused outofband management port from 192.168.40.x to an unused network segment and immediately the switch management interface would accept and route traffic from my vlan 40 nodes. very odd behavior for something that should be outofband. really appreciate all your suggestions and assistance. || sounds like theres acls access control list in place. what does the command show ipaccess lists display? || is ip routing turned on? || is at least one interface with vlan 10 online? not sure if every switch does it but i know hparuba switches will disable a vlan if there are no active ports."
