Network Monitoring

Monitor the health and performance of your entire network infrastructure in a single unified platform. Alleviate networking points of friction with increased visibility, and leverage network logs and metrics to speed up troubleshooting across all network and IT devices.

Supported brands include:

Comprehensive visibility into your entire network

LogicMonitor empowers you to discover devices, track traffic, analyze syslog data, and detect anomalies in real-time. Resolve issues proactively and ensure seamless network performance from one unified platform.

2000+ out-of-the-box integrations for top brands like Cisco, Juniper, Meraki and more allows for autodiscovery of any device on any network.

Discover and map relationships between critical infrastructure resources. Dynamic auto-generated topology maps allow you to contextualize network traffic and alerts in real-time.

End-to-end visibility with unified network logs and metrics and intelligent alerting thresholds solves network issues at lightning speed.Learn more

Any device. Any network.

The LogicMonitor platform provides comprehensive monitoring for every kind of modern enterprise network so you can eliminate visibility gaps and break down silos.

Network monitoring that deploys in minutes at any scale

LogicMonitor utilizes a lightweight, agentless collector that automatically discovers everything you need to know about your network.

Get the coverage you need for the most complex networks – whether resources are on-premises, spread across multiple data centers, or in the cloud.

Improve network health and optimize performance

When problems arise, resolve them faster than ever before with LogicMonitor’s suite of troubleshooting capabilities. Unified network logs and metrics quickly pinpoint the root cause of network availability and performance issues.

LogicMonitor’s dashboards, topology mapping, log-based anomaly detection, and forecasting, elevate visibility into networks to minimize service issues and performance bottlenecks.

With auto-generated topology mapping, LogicMonitor allows you to discover and map relationships between critical infrastructure resources. Drill down further and generate a topology map based on an alert to streamline your troubleshooting workflow and quickly discover the root cause of performance-impacting issues.

Full network visibility into the metrics that matter

Metrics alone do not provide meaningful insights into network health and performance. Traditional network monitoring tools fail to provide full visibility into the connectivity of network devices in modern environments and don’t integrate access to critical network log data to provide context into the events needed for troubleshooting. With LogicMonitor:

See how we stack up

The entire health and performance of our website can be easily monitored with the help of LogicMonitor. Also, we use it to seamlessly monitor our end user application performance. There is 100% transparency and the troubleshooting is very much simplified which helps us achieve more efficiency in our day to day process.

It’s great since we don’t have to install bothersome agents on the devices or hardware that we want to monitor. I didn’t even need to consult the instructions or contact customer support when I wanted to add a device; the process is simple and easy to follow.

Network monitoring benefits

Discover efficiencies

Consolidate workflows to monitor network performance and troubleshooting with unified network logs and metrics. Leverage anomaly detection and dynamic thresholds to identify potential network service issues with actionable insights and enhanced data to minimize impact to customers and employees.

Detect anomalies and outliers

Pinpoint the root cause of potentially malicious traffic to take control of your network, follow log-based network log anomalies to reduce MTTR, and follow contextual analysis to monitored IT devices.Know exactly why network service was impacted and quickly identify, fix, and learn.

Adaptive monitoring

Invest in network monitoring that meets the needs of new technology like cloud computing, virtualization, and SD-WAN or SASE to ensure network availability and performance. Deploy, add devices, and manage network access to optimize your network infrastructure for modern hybrid and multi cloud environments.

Network monitoring FAQs

Network monitoring provides the real-time information needed to determine the overall performance of a computer network. These solutions proactively detect and provide solutions for problems in a network by comparing live performance against an expected performance baseline.

Networks can be monitored by discovering devices within a network and correlating that information with the data those devices on the network are outputting.

Monitoring your network is crucial for businesses to ensure uptime within your network, to troubleshoot issues, and to proactively plan for the future.

LogicMonitor’s cloud-based observability platform is a leader for network monitoring, infrastructure monitoring, and beyond.

Networks need to be monitored to maintain uptime. Monitoring specific devices within each network can show what resources are being allocated where, and what devices are using the most bandwidth.

LogicMonitor’s network monitoring is agentless, so no physical devices need to be installed to start monitoring your entire network.

Network performance monitoring measures the real-time health of your entire network of connected devices, to ensure reliability and uptime.

Network topology mapping is the process of graphing network-connected devices and the data collected within devices together to form a map of where network data streams through and how.

Network monitoring measures all of the devices within a network, while network performance monitoring measures the overall health of that network. The two terms are similar, and in most functional instances can be used interchangeably.
