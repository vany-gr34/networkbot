Nagios vs Zabbix,"hi fellow network people, i am going to be evaluating some monitoring tools. goals is to find a tool which will suit monitoring about 30ish locations, with a mix of network vendors. budget is a bit of an issue.. the organisation is a non profit organisation heavily relying on government and local funding. edit this doesnt mean it needs to be a free tool, but it needs to be affordable and usable without to many customization work or expert knowledge prtg and zabbix seem to be for the two id like to get started with, also open to other alternatives in that class random question does anyone have any insights about how expensive solarwinds is? looking forward to hearing your experiences || the same company who bought prtg and increased their pricing just bought solarwinds, so i honestly would not look to either solution if cost management is a big concern. there are plenty of purely free open source tools in the network space that are perfectly capably with lots of history and existing documentation like zabbix or librenms. at that scale i probably wouldnt implement something like prometheus because its just a bit more of a chore to manage and a non profit with 30 locations probably isnt big enough to leverage the benefits of those kind of technologies and would have a hard time affording the kind of staff who are already familiar with them. || anything but solar winds. prtg if you want to spend money on licensing. zabbix if you want to spend money on labor hours. || zabbix is great once you get over the learning curve. ptrg is more user friendly at the beginning. zabbix can do more once you understand how to setup the triggers. you can also do live network maps like cacti, which ptrg is weirdly missing. i got rid of our prtg setup for zabbix."
Nagios vs Zabbix,"currently running librenms for everything network related. systems team are using xymon and are looking into other options for server and process monitoring. we were thinking of combining everything into zabbix as it appears to have enough flexibility to do both. wondered what the communities thoughts are on libre vs zabbix for network monitoring.is libre feasible options for server and process monitoring or would zabbix be a better overall choice? edit well this got more traction than i was expecting . thanks for all your comments this was actually super helpful. i think i will let our linux team kick the tires on zabbix to see if it can do what we need it to. we love prometheus and anything that integrates with it cleanly will have a head start. i love libre it has been solid for me but having a consolidated monitoring platform would be a big time saver. || we switched from solarwinds to zabbix. its great but will require development for some devices likely. also it can be fun to figure out performance problems as you scale up. it can pretty much monitor anything however. one insight i will give is to limit access on users. we had an issue where someone left a super admin account with basic password and some bad actor was using zabbixes ability to execute apps remotely with anything running zabbix agent or proxy. || personally ive found libre to be much more straightforward to set up and get running than zabbix, while zabbix is arguably more powerful but its also more complicated and involved. libre has its roots in observium, which started out as a replacement for cricket, cacti, mrtg etc. basically using snmp to poll devices and then create pretty graphs. features like alerting, integration with oxidized and smokeping, etc were added later and in my opinion are fine but probably need to be refined and extended a bit more. zabbix seems to have had a different focus monitoring and alerting so its not as pretty as libre again, my opinion but it is a lot more mature when it comes to those functions. || we monitor everything in checkmk. from servers and containers to network equipment. works great and everything is centralized in one place which is very helpful. we still use librenms for traffic billing but all the monitoring and alerting is being done with checkmk. zabbix is pretty hard to setup in my opinion and works best if you have a lot of devices that need to be monitored the same. we chose checkmk because its more of a plugandplay experience. librenms observium is also a very easy plugandplay experience and doesnt require a lot of setup. i think even less setup than checkmk. but it cannot monitor servers and services. edit to clarify, librenms and observium can monitor servers but its not as detailed as checkmk or zabbix."
Nagios vs Zabbix,"hi there guys and gals, network enthusiats. long time lurker, but first time to post here i have a university project where i need to compare, contrast and maybe make improvements in regard to different fhrp protocols like hsrp, vrrp v2 and maybe v3? and glbp from cisco. for this purpose i have bought subscription to cisco cml personal license to be able to simulate the environment as i do not have cisco gear at my home lab. of the hardware devices i have, there are two dell 7048 switches, one brocade 745048 and one dell force10 s60 switch. of these switches i have not yet had time to start up and configure brocade switch as i need special console cable. if somebody can recommend a way to use physical servers to maybe set up a real environment where a couple of vms could be connected via different ports to different switches, i would appreciate. also to note that i have an hp dl380p g8 server with 2 xeon e52640 v2 cpus with about 200gb of memory and thus far installed mellanox connectx3 pro in form of hp 544flrqsfp ethernet adapter and also ordered a one connectx6 dx from ebay which should come in a couple of days. i have not had experience with newer models of connectx adapters but i have read they support ovs offloads, and will need to read more about that how to set it up in my goal of virtualizing the simulated network. as my server is running windows server 2019, so far i have set up cisco cml v2.5.0 with hyperv, even though it is not officially supported, but i plan on getting another drive just to install esxi on it to have that available and to reinstall latest cisco cml which is 2.5.1 release as of 14apr2023. or even maybe install cml as bare install without hypervisor to do nested virtualization. my first idea of a network was very simple for a couple of nodes 1 for generating traffic, 1 for receiving, 2 routers at least or l3 switches and maybe 1 or 2 machines to capture traffic to be able to calculate network metrics like packet loss, bandwidth, throughput, latency, retransmission rate, availability. i presume either span of ports on which machine for generation of traffic is connected to send that 1 machine responsible for traffic analysis, or a virtual tap which would also redirect traffic to that machine. for that purpose i would use some of the network monitoring tools like the ones from solarwinds, prtg, icinga, manageengine or even open source solutions like librenms, opennms, zabbix and nagios. or maybe even better if there are solutions for packet capture based software which have an option of a vm based deployment. i have found a couple of them like ixia, extrahop, skylight, gigamon and netscout but i am not that knowledgeable in how to setup and use them would need some recommendation and advice here. i have also bought ostinato for cml if trex from cisco would not be suitable, but i do not have any experience with either also some recommendations here are welcome. do you see some gaps here or possible places to improve, or can you advise better way to go about this goal, please do comment. thanks in advance for all the help guys. || "
Nagios vs Zabbix,"looking for an nms solution for my company that can be run efficiently as a vm. i have used nagios, zabbix, and solarwinds in the past. i currently have zabbix running on a standalone server but would like to create a vm for ease of migration in the future when we upgrade some of our hosts and ii can add other network managementrelated vms. zabbix documentation doesnt recommend using it as a vm. i was curious if any of you out there had any experience with open source nmss running as a vm in your production environments. cheers! || librenms || zabbix has downloadable vm images and containers. where is it documented not to use a vm? || icinga2"
Nagios vs Zabbix,"i have a nonprofit public school radio station that i provide the it and engineering support for. i would like to implement a network monitoring system to provide alerting and statistics for the networks within the station. note that although this is part of, and physically in, a public school, the radio station network operates independently from the rest of the school including its own connection to the internet. the big issue i have is budgetary which should not really be a surprise i have 0 to spend on this. i am, therefore, looking for something free and open source. i know there are several things out there that exist for this, nagios is the only one i am familiar with. while i like the powerflexibility of nagios, i do not like the way it has to be managed nagios core, not the purchased package with editing configuration files to addremovechange monitored hosts, networks, etc. my ideal list of features not in any particular order freelow cost us100 see my budget note above. i would be paying for this out of pocket able to monitor network devices switches, mainly, windows pcs windows 10 and windows 10 ltsc, linux machines mostly some flavor of debianbased ubuntu primarily at the moment, and other hardware devices telos axia livewire nodes, eas endec, radiosystems livewire consoles, etc., apc upss, etc. this use of additional plugin modules to enable some or all of the monitoring is acceptable. the use of snmp for monitoring devices is acceptable, i can get mib files for some of the common items. the audio hardware may be a bit difficult i need to check with the vendor. also the ability to monitor specific applications on a windows machine mainly whether they are running or not. clientside software for os monitoring is acceptable. gui web page is perfectly fine for both status and configuration the latter is a preferred option, but not strictly mandatory see my nagios comment ability to alert on userdefined parameters i.e. ups input voltage highlow, device down, disk capacity approaching full, etc. ability to receive snmp traps and respond per userdefines responses snmp traps reception is not absolutely necessary, but would be nice to have. ability to send email alerts via smtp server that utilizes tls for connectivity ability to run under linux or, if a complete appliance image, uses linux or similar as the underlying os is preferred over a windowsbased solution. ability to install and run on our own hardware i have some handmedown servers from the school district i am repurposing. searching, i have seen the aforementioned nagios core, also zabbix, cacti, prometheus, icinga, checkmk raw edition, observium community, and others a few of which i have heard the name before, most i never heard of. ideally, i am looking for a recommendation that you, personally, have used or currently use. at work my real job we use a combination of solarwinds orion, hp openview, and some custom i.e. home grown scripting, and have everything integrated with service now. i need no such integration for the school, and the costs of the commercial solutions are very much outside my price range. || librenms is a great option and checked most all your boxes. it only supports snmp, so monitoring for windows is pretty basic and wont do processservice monitoring. it works great for linux, network gear, upses, etc though. checkmk i think checks all the boxes. it has agents for windows and linux and can do snmp for everything else. its just not as user friendly as librenms. || 1 for checkmk fits what you are looking for and works well with your budget! does more than just basic monitoring amazing graphs. if you want to add mobile alerting have a look at signl4 offers a free version for push notifications in the mobile app. || why does everyone assume nonprofit no budget. nonprofits get mahooosive discounts with almost all vendors. so youd be surprised what you can afford. do some research before you write off a paid for solution."
Nagios vs Zabbix,"im trying to keep a better eye on our bgp peering stats, particularly prefixes received vs prefixes accepted per bgp neighbor, as well as state of the session and overall memory used by the router process and its data. i cant seem to find any standard snmp mibs for these stats, but i was wondering if there were native plugins for zenoss or zabbix that can poll these things? || not sure about dell but librenms can do those on cisco devices out of the box with snmp. || show command automation. also try to see what snmp has available. could always debug bgp stuff and then send it to syslog server, parse there. ive also heard netflow used but i havent tried that."
Nagios vs Zabbix,"hey guys, we are just planning a datacentre environment. everything from core switching to hosts will be hpe, firewalling will be pfsense maybe sophos, just in decision. storage is handled through datacentre including monitoring. for monitoring at vm level we will use our rmm tool. just thinking about open source monitoring, on my list is check mk, zabbix, icinga, prometheus, nagios main requirements are hardware monitoring, hpe ilo, hpe aruba switches hyperv monitoring, including cpu ready times, cluster health wan, vpn, network traffic we would love to use visualization thorugh grafana because this is already set up with other dbs would be cool having some feedback what you guys are using. thanks in advance! || prometheus can do pretty much all of that. youll likely need a few specific exporters. fore example for ilo. i found an hp ilo exporter, but its pretty cringe passwords as url params, nooooope. for datacenter environments, youll also probably run into the need for the to get to some physical plant stuff like generators, hvac, etc that only speak modbus. disclaimer im a prometheus contributor || librenms is pretty amazing || librenms. simply because it does so much right, right out of the box. seamless integration with nagios plugins for everything nonsnmp, graylog for syslog, can also do syslog natively, api for allowing for example grafana to do its thing. friendly community, active development, mature project. check, check, check."
Nagios vs Zabbix,"hey guys, im a networkingmedia tech guy for an isolated media network. the network is about 100 users connected to a media server for video editing. the server itself is 8 chassis stripped together as one big server with 128 hdds. so the maintance for this server is a big job. plus its about 5 years old already! our media network works behind the client run internet. the clients parent company owns the building and provides internet. so to my question. i want to monitor the server remotely. but the parent company is no internet. but its not our clients policy, its the execs policy above her. so i have a secure 256 aes open vpn tunnel that uses wan whitelisted blocked ips and certificates with ta keys. my openvpn network is set to auto update the os and as an additional security measure it auto blocks any wan attempt to get in. only a few guys have a key and cert to access the tunnel. on my tunnel i have zabbix and nagios to monitor and report the health of the server. so ive already tested the client network and it does allow my phoning home connection to establish. so i know they are allowing vpns. most likely due to their own it needs to administer the network. it seems to me that if you let the it guys tunnel in then you should let the media network guys tunnel in. im pissed they are going to take away my monitor solution. its gonna be so hard to maintain that server a long with all the other servers we maintain from other clients. what would you guys do? hook up a low key vpn server on site, or through in the towel and wait for the client to call when they are having issues? || breaking their policy sounds like a good way to get fired or worse. i bet everyone in this group has to work with stupid policies inforced by execs, even if it makes their job harder. || it seems to me that if you let the it guys tunnel in then you should let the media network guys tunnel in. why? youre passing through their network, not yours. leaving a vpn theyre unaware of, if their policy is against it, for them to find sounds like a bad time. || you should do what your client dictates. if someone alleges that youve exfiltrated data its really easy for them to throw the book at you, ultimately it may not go anywhere but this sort of thing can be really unpleasant. if you cant have a productive discussion about contractual requirements with your management either collect your money and keep your mouth shut or find a workplace you align with better."
Nagios vs Zabbix,"hey guys, so im setting up a it monitoring solution for my servers. we have a bunch of servers all over the city with vpn access so i can either pull snmp or install an agent on them and get monitoring information that way. i setup zabbix and it works okay. im trying to get uncorrectable error counts via smartctl on linux servers. it works for sata drives but not for sas drives. im wondering if anyone else has set something like this up. im also considering nagios as it might be more popular so there might be more support to get these uncorrectable error counts via nagios plugin. what do you guys think? i know nagios cost like 4 grand, and zabbix is free, so thats kind of a huge deal, but i can get the 4 grand from my company if i need too. i just want a reliable way to preemptively get the uncorrectable errors from my servers so i dont have emergencies all the freaking time, so annoying. || nagios xi costs money. the og nagios is free and still works very well, albeit a bit of a mess of configuration files. its also compatible with thousands of plugins and its very easy to write your own. it is a bit of a dinosaur, but it just works. || the zabbix agent can poll whatever you can poll from your os. if your script to get the errors works, zabbix can collect it. have a look at share.zabbix.com for a lot of community templates and scripts. i imagine this is the same for the other monitoring solutions out there. this issue is more looking like a configscript issue to me. || checkmk instead"
Nagios vs Zabbix,"hi rnetworking anyone caring to share any free nms software with me. i am more interested in monitoring rather than managing, although thats a welcoming feature too. my key needs are topological availability basically a maptopology showing me the devices health signsavailability. crucial as the map will represent the physical connectivity. snmp something thatll give me information for the node objects. basic health signs in case where a device does not have snmp, something that pollspings the device through ip in a regular basis. x200b so far, my research uncovered more application monitoring systems, which have way too many features that i dont need and unfortunately all the monitoring solutions seem to dedicate a lot of ui in that direction. last monitoring software i used was whatsup gold, but it seems to have changed drastically. i remember using v14, which looks completely different to the current ones. i know its not a free option, but anything that looks similar to that functionality would be fantastic. ive looked at solutions like nagios, zenoss, zabbix, but it looks like something none of my workers would dare to go for due to the complexity of adding a single node to an existing group. x200b edit forgot to mention that the network consists of various brands. || check observium or its fork librenms and maybe also centreon. || librenms is what we use here and love it. it pretty much keeps itself up to date and very easy to use. has a lot of addons. || im using librenms for monitoring and find it can be as simple or as complicated as you make it. it does have a mapping feature a plugin iirc, but i prefer netdisco for the mapdiscovery."
