EVE-NG monitoring configuration,"hey all, i dont have a plethora of experience in specifics in networking. ive used and set up vlans, nats, and subnets multiple times. i work in the industrial automatic space for an oem that makes packaging equipment. our customers are often bigger companies that have their own specifications for networking. generally it makes sense and aligns with my understanding of networking hierarchy and security. but we have one customer who requires us to use managed switches, and will dictate to us which ip addresses we can use and often get down to the specifics of which deviceip is connected to which port on the switch. they require us to ship them the switch were using so they can provision and configure it, then they ship it back. all of that is fine, and makes sense. the confusing part for me is that in their specifications documentation, it specifies that a nat cannot be used anywhere in the system. what inevitably happens is the systems principal controller plc first port is on a specified subnet with the rest of the equipmentdevices. the controllers second port is configured to a different subnet, which then connects to the customers intranet through the managed switch to be monitored and maintained. i recently asked the person who essentially leads all automation equipment purchasing for that customer, and i asked if he knew why the company has a firm requirement of not using a nat. he just said, ohhh, no no no. nats are a big nono. since then, ive been reading and i, for the life of me, cannot understand why this could be. but i also admit i dont know enough to know where to look. in my mind, the way the second port is configured and then connected through the switch mimics the actions of a nat. can someone explain how im a silly goose thats overlooking something? thanks in advance! || ot equipment and their vendors are notoriously bad at anything security related. especially the vpn devices the vendors love to try to sneak on to the network to have remote access to their stuff. there is no need for nat if i give you the address space to use and a gateway to route traffic to. also, when i have to yank that vpn device out because the vendor has been hacked again i can easily replace it with my own. ifwhen we want to expand or connect or add additional automation or collect data i can do that with out having to rely on you to come back and readdress the equipment so that its routable on my network. ive seen ot equipment using insane subnets that are routable over the public internet. no your plc cannot have an address of 1.1.1.1 or 1.2.3.4 and no your hmi cannot be 8.8.8.8 or any other random address ive seen outside of rfc1918. long story short, its our network, if your equipment cant handle different ip addresses from whatever you think it should be, it is not welcome in our environment. that being said i bend over backwards to get ot vendors to see the light and do things the right way. || nat sometimes breaks applications. || for mei can see a couple reasons. one is to make sure devices stay physically isolated. no gateway to the outside world. only the plc and its endpoints. i also know plcs and vfds can be harsh on a network and having nat manage that net can cause issues with its broadcast multicast storms. and it may be a security red safety system policy that isolated networks are in place with no possible way to interfere with the safety control endpoints. the absence of nat also means no openvpn, openssl, wireguard, ipsec etc. can possibly gain access."
EVE-NG monitoring configuration,"hello fellow networking folks, im currently trying to build a small monitoring solution for multicasts. in our lab we have a nexus9000 c93108tcex running version 7.0. i want to start with this device and maybe later continue supporting others. the goal is to see for each interface which multicasts are entering and which are leaving. sflow seems to be a viable solution for this problem since it just samples a defined subset of all the packets passing through the monitored interfaces. for each sampled packets sflow provides some additional information. for me the source id index and the input interface value are most interesting. i am keeping to the field descriptions provided by wireshark since different sources call them differently. when a packets arrives from outside the switch on one monitored interface, everything works flawlessly. i can compare the two values to the values in the mibii interface description. both values match as they should. when a packets is leaving the switch the story goes differently. the input interface value is correct so i can still see, on which physical interface a packet entered the switch. source id index always displays hex 0x80000000. it should show the interface i am monitoring right now, the interface from wich the packet was sampled. if the situation stays like that i can only properly monitor incoming multicasts but i cannot monitor through which interfaces packets leave the switch. in my opinion the cisco documentation is not really clear if this behavior is expected or not. for nxos 10.5 i found sflow does not support egress sampling for multicast, broadcast, or unknown unicast packets. but the nxos 7 documentation states egress sflow of multicast traffic requires hardware multicast globaltxspan configuration. which i tried. the other sentence in there drove me totally nuts for an ingress sflow sample of multicast packets, the out port is reported as multiple ports with the exact number of egress ports. this is not supported on cisco nexus 9300ex and fxp platform switches. like, what does this even mean? i would interpret it as you can see how many interfaces an incoming packet will go to, but not on your device. but that should not affect what i can see on the sampled egress packet, right? i assume that either i am not smart enough to read the documentation correctly or the documentation is not coherent. so my question is is it possible to correctly sample the information for egress multicast traffic with my switch and if so, what needs to be done. if it is not possible i am interested how well other vendors support sflow monitoring of multicast packet especially arista. is it only cisco implementing it weirdly or is there a bigger reason for this. im also thinking about possible alternatives for my implementation and if you think they could be possible 1. combine the snooping and group report with the input data show ip igmp snooping groups. this would be possible but is no true monitoring. i wouldnt know when the switch does not pass a packet. 2. cycle the sflow monitoring port. if i monitor only one port at a time i always know where a one multicast enters and where it leaves 3. i look at some other interface data counters or something similar if there are any correlations i can use to match output multicasts to interfaces in some way. if you have any ideas id appreciate your help. || "

EVE-NG monitoring configuration,"hi there! were currently moving our office to a new building and want to start having a firewall there due to growth in staff and plans for getting tisax certified. were having round about 50 employees. a firewall for us should provide at least segmentation access control enhanced logging and monitoring ideally with built in reporting idsips threat protection vpn with entraid what would be good documented in sense of configuration for a nonfirewall expert and reasonable priced options? || in sense of configuration for a nonfirewall expert nope. chance of success zero. i just read an overview of tisax and i dont see how you can successfully achieve the levels of security maturity to receive that certification as an organization without a network security professional or three on staff, or the engagement of outside professional assistance. youre going to need more than just a firewall, youre probably going to need dataloss prevention, and secure document storage and all kinds of stuff that will require a fairly constant stream of care feeding. its possible im over thinking it as ive only read a single ai summary, but thats my thoughts on it. || generally non experts should find a trusted msp or consultant to handle this for them. its very important to find a good msp. ie. dont go with the one i used to work for. || none. and youre going to need more than just a firewall. best to hire a staff msp to meet those."
EVE-NG monitoring configuration,"hello there! have you ever had an issue like that? context k12, about 1k devices connected per day, 10 vlans one for each building. the vlan with the issues is the students wifi vlan. this vlan is only configured on trunk links with the native vlan being the aps management vlan and all the tagged vlans that should be on that link, including the students one. what bugged me is that even with an ethernet connection configured with the students vlan, i still have constant drops to 10mbps. i already checked stp and arp storms with wireshark, and everything seems fine. important this vlan is present in the entire campus since its for the students wifi. how are you testing and monitoring bandwidth, and at what points? im using iperf and testing with all the students in campus i know that it could be the number of clients, but we had a stable 100mbps for everyone for the past 6 months. what is handling routing for that vlan and subnet? our core switch. what is the bandwidth of your ap switch, switch switch, and building building links? also what do you have for isp bandwidth? everything is configured for 1 gbps. multihomed isp links with fiber at 400mbps each link 2 links. any ideas on what could be the cause of the issue? || not nearly enough information to stat troubleshooting such a problem. how are you testing and monitoring bandwidth, and at what points? what is handling routing for that vlan and subnet? what is the bandwidth of your ap switch, switch switch, and building building links? also what do you have for isp bandwidth? || 802.11b enabled on the aps? || make sure every physical link is running at full duplex. make sure all your interfaces are not taking on packet loss. if they are, check cabling."

EVE-NG monitoring configuration,"i might be looking for a unicorn device but im hoping someone might have an idea of the options out there. usecase were an isp and have a lot of business customers with two uplinks to our pe devices but a single ip homed on these devices that acts as their default gateway. these pe devices are currently cisco 3750s or 3850s in a stackvss configuration so they are logically 1 device. we are looking at replacing these devices, but dont know what our best option would be. this is very important the stackvss gives us high availability protection if one of devices in the stack dies while not requiring us to use 3 ips from our customers network range. afaik requiring 3 ips is the biggest drawback for protocols like vrrp and why a pair of devices working in an mlag will not meet our requirements. requirements stackable able to share an ip so if one device dies, the others in the stack will still respondpass traffic with the same ip. this could also be a single device but with dualsupervisors, just something that will provide us with physical redundancy. linkagglacp interface 1 on stackmembera and interface 2 on stackmemberb should be able to be put into a portchannel together going down to the customer so that the customer device has 2 uplinks but sees our devices as 1 logical device. ospf the device ideally needs to be able to speak ospf so it can get routes from our upstream router and know where to send customer traffic. if it cant do ospf, then at least it needs to be able to do ip sla so we can setup static routes and monitor them, but ospf would be easier 10g ports we have a mix of 1g and 10g customers, mostly 1g. the device needs to have at least 10g capable uplinks and ideally 10g capable interfaces for customer access sfp the easiest thing would be for the device to use sfps so we can mix and match the module depending on if the customer has a fiber or copper handoff low portdensity we typically dont need 48 ports. something with 12 or even 6 ports would be fine. we deploy these devices at the customers location and only occasionally have more than one customer running over a given pair of devices 2keuros a device this one might be tricky, but were not against buying used. so yeah, that might be a unicorn but we need something that has physical redundancy and that can share an ip across that physical redundancy. we already have a lot of customers on our existing gear with 30s and so going the mlag vrrp route is not an option for us. unless there is some hardwarefeature set with mlag that provides the same shared ip functionality as vss || if you implement evpn in your fibre aggregation layer, you can take lags from your customer switches directly and then terminate a single 31 gateway on two pes for protection. same ip, two devices. totally valid in evpn. as evpn relies on bgp there is no vendor stack technology to fail in this design, making it superior to a stack. while your fibre aggregation might not support this now, the savings on edge devices may justify this approach. || unpopular opinion, stop doing that. almost every isp only offers a single handoff from a single device. the cpe isnt the weak point, typically. || extreme networks can do this with a 5420. in an mclag cluster, they have a proprietary alternative to vrrp that only needs 1 ip address."
