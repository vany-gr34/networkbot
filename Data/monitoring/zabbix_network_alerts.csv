zabbix network alerts,"hey folks, my company is in the process of implementing thousandeyes, and im new to the tool. ive gone through the documentation and understand there are different types of tests like http server, page load, network, dns, etc., but im trying to get a clearer picture for a realworld use case. my manager has asked me to explain how we can effectively utilize thousandeyes in our environment cisco sdwan , webex contact center beyond just running basic tests. were mostly interested in improving visibility and troubleshooting for network and application performance, but im not sure what the best practices are, or how others are leveraging it daytoday. would appreciate if anyone can share common use cases in your organization what tests you rely on the most any tips or gotchas for managingautomating alerts or dashboards things you wish youd known when getting started || thousandeyes falls in to the category of products known as digital experience monitoring. rum real user monitoring is fulfilled by endpoint agents, a lightweight agent gathering statistical performance data from your enduser laptops desktops. the cloud enterprise agents perform synthetic transaction monitoring the endpoint agents have a very limited set of stm tests they can also run. these are the network, dns, etc., tests that you referred to. rum is great as a triage tool. when joe calls the helpdesk and says i had a terrible webex call, the endpoint data can point to causes like high cpu, poor firsthop performance, bad wifi signal, etc.. this affords helpdesk the visibility to close tickets before they go up to more advanced engineers responsible for client engineering, networking, app owners, you get the idea. synthetic tests are best used to evaluate either critical services, or, critical network paths. think about a sla attached to a customerfacing biz app. you may want to run synthetic tests from a combination of cloud, endpoint, and enterprise agents, to effectively measure your service availability latency. i would try to pick agents that best represent the locations of your users. if your apps are primarily you can validate that not only is the socket open, but that you are getting back the correct http response code or script for more advanced web workflows. otherwise you fake it with an agenttoserver test and point to the appropriate combination of protocol port, you just wont negotiate an actual session. you may also want to run agenttoagent synthetic tests to validate critical network paths. this could be sitetosite, sitetocloud, or even within a dc or lan. this could leverage a combo of enterprise and cloud agents as needed. id start by making a list of critical services, critical users, and frequent problem areas. build your tests around that and see what you learn. as others have mentioned, their licenses are big money, and you want to maximize the value. engage your cisco account team as they will be thrilled to help you get set up the more you succeed, the more likely leadership will want to buy more, so theyre incentivized. btw... this does not replace traditional flow and packet based performance monitoring. || depends on your budget hoe much monitoring you can enable. or.. tokens || te is very overpriced for most folks if you are just going to pinghttp test from your branches, there is free software that can do this. also note they charge you per test, despite your enterprise agents running on your hardware. if you rely on a lot of internetbased apps, it can be very helpful, or if you dont have smokeping or something already. || for sdwan monitoring, then you can set up tests on the overlay, then tests for the underlay and program the sdwan to drop the underlay test packets down. for webex, there are two things you may want to monitor. on the enterprise agents, set up an agent to agent test from your enterprise agents to the webex cloud agent that your site will probably communicate with. then for your endpoint agents, enable the on demand test for webex for any other application it depends on the application and how the application works. || im a var and helped a few clients stand up thousandeyes for sdwan visibility and app performance, especially around things like webex, salesforce, and o365. the most useful tests have been continuous http server tests for saas monitoring, bgp path visualization, and endpoint agents for branchtocloud visibility. dashboards and alerting take a bit of finetuning early on, especially if you want to avoid noise. shoot me a dm if you want more infosupport! || you need to make sure your agents are deployed in the right locations. can be deployed in the right locations and you have a good story around updating and patching them. without going into very specific tests the 1 minute agent to agent tests are pretty good. they open a tcp stream and spread packets throughout that 1 minute window giving good data on latency, packet loss etc once agents are deployed everything else can be configured. enterprise agents to cloud providers, custom tests, whatever. te has a good terraform provider, its a nice easy way to turn tests offon, save on credits, document the tests for future reference and learn a new skill in the process. || were a cisco shop and we upgraded our network recently so we got a ton of te entitlements. im honestly not finding it very useful. there have been a handful of cases where an endpoint agent would have been nice to have but we were told the minimum you can buy is 100. wed probably only ever use 5 at once so theres no way wed pay tens of thousands for access to the endpoint agents. otherwise the only real use i got out of it was setting up a bgp monitor in our network which allows me to see what as hops a packet will take. not useful at all but interesting to know. not a very helpful comment but id figure id share. edit endpoint agent, not enterprise. || disclaimer i am not from ciscothousandeyes. i am just one of their happy customers. i share some details below, which are my personal opinion. under the hood it uses common troubleshooting tools like ping, traceroute, curl, dig, etc. in a way it is nothing new or can be replicated easily. real strong points of thousandeyes 1 if you use have 90 cisco gear in your environment, you can deploy an agent on supported cisco devices almost anywhere. we have a few agents at each branch sites. it is that simple to install. the agents are quite stable. common issues i have seen is the hosting hardware failing or internet thousandeyes is saas so ... acting up. 2 cloud agents. these are enterprise agents but hosted by te. this is really good as it gives you the option to probe from the internet. you can use it to probe other stuff in the internet or maybe a public facing enterprise resource. 3 ability to do ad hoc probes from hundreds of agents. very nice for troubleshooting. 4 if you set up ongoing tests, you have historical data on what you are probing for up to 2 months. very useful or rcas or to proof that the issue was not on network side. 5 gui is nice and easy to navigate. support is excellent. i personally rank them higher than tac and meraki support. success stories 1 identifying exactly a routing point of failure in isp upstream and having isp to change the design for that particular link. 2 application monitoring. you will be surprised with what this can pick up, from server issues to dns issues to dns routing issues and of course network issues. cons 1 it is very expensive. 2 its value is only as good as the usecase you can come up with. what you should note 1 since thousandeyes uses icmp amongst others under the hood, check with your security guys if they allow such traffic. if they dont then you lose like 30 of the value from no path visualization data. 2 think hard about your usecases. while i am happy with thousandeyes, i admit that it is not the solution to everything and there are usually simpler cheaper alternatives out there. hope this helps."
zabbix network alerts,"hi everyone, i work for a software company and our company has been pushing us to go all in on ai this year. weve had several meetings and there have been some super neat projects that have been shown by various development teams or things of that nature but i feel like i cant find anything useful that we can point to other than stuff weve been using for years like our ncm or firewall related logs alerting us proactively or what not. today we were told that if we arent using ai that we are being left behind and i feel super discouraged because we get asked by our management that we need to show that we are using ai in our daily tasks but yet other than what i mentioned above i cant point to anything. ive been in it for 20 years and been a network engineer for 11 of those and its not that im resistant to change but i dont know where to really start the network is the heart of everything that everyone uses. how are you using ai in your daily work just looking for examples or maybe think outside of the box i feel like im not seeing the big picture or that one thing of here is something cool you can do and implement thanks for reading. || hey chat gpt, here is my private network configuration data, please dont share it with anyone else || i use ai to write emails back to management. technically, it has no real value beyond barfing out error prone snippets. || i dont. || i kind of use it like google now. take the results i get. maybe pry a little more. than do my own research from there if needed || i use chatgpt a ton when im writing python. the big trick is keeping your questions pretty limited in scope and provide as much context as possible itll kick back garbage if you ask it to write an entire program. situations where youre like how tf do i do this. different variations on syntax, ways to organize your code, example classes, ideas for packages to use, basic ways to do x. basically anything you could put in a stack overflow question that would get you roasted. || im not. it sounds like theyre trying to force something into your toolkit when they dont even know how or why. im not saying there are no practical uses, but thats like saying you have to use excel once a week or youll be left behind. why? || i use it ... to test my firewall based ai app blocking acl is working properly, to prevent the exfiltrating of corporate data to whatever llm flavor of the week the users heard about on some podcast last night. || im not. i work at a regional telco. we dont have enough of anything other than virtual machines to even think about what folks were calling mass automation yesterday. ive seen some compelling use cases for machine learning in applications like ddos mitigation and wifi stuff. unfortunately, nothing relevant to our scale. today we were told that if we arent using ai that we are being left behind yes thats the big lie that the gutless tech media has been regurgitating. sam altman and softbank have been telling everyone this because they spent too far much money doing absolutely nothing and its going to implode the world economy, if the us government doesnt do it first. if you find a good tool you should use it. this is like management telling everyone theyve got to get smart screwdrivers. first of all, what the fuck does that even mean, and second, why? fanatical dogma isnt useful. hopefully this is some pinhead middle manager and not the people actually driving the company. || its good at analysing a lot of data. backups, cam tables , logs, configuration standards. i wouldnt give it anything tho unless youre in control of what it does with it. || everything. use it to help with ansible errors and to help write tasks. use it to help bring programs online such as akvorado, catalyst center, nautobot, etc... whenever i run into a linux, docker error. i use it to refresh my memory on networking stuff i me be a little rusty on. i use it to help write technical emails, hell even used it for a self review. extremely useful, anyone who says otherwise has an ulterior motive or just doesnt know how to use ai efficiently. its a productivity multiplier. saves time and energy. it is not capable of replacing me. || only to ask it stuff to get quick answers. does the xyz have 10g ports? but im not entirely sure i and trust it. || hey claudechatgptgemini, take this swagger file and write me a script to extract entries from the api, split some fields based on a delimiter, and dump them out to a csv. now write a script to update the api entries based on the csv. hey llm, write me a script using scrapli to connect to devices using a connection pool, run a command, then process the return value through the appropriate textfsm template from ntctemplates, and return a json formatted payload. oh, and have it use fastapi so it can create a selfdocumenting openapi spec. || hey chatgpt show me how to config a dhcp server for a juniper on cli i have to touch a juniper once every few years, so the commands arent at my immediate disposal || im a field engineer job title, who does a mix of systems, networking, ot automation, etc due to a neurological issue, my memory and cognitive function isnt what it used to be. i have difficulty retaining information, and unless i use something regularly, i can forget it easily. it may just sound like old age, but its terrible. llms have been an absolute game changer for me. i use them in a very basic way, to help remember commands or procedures i dont use often. || day to day? im not. most frequent? anytime i need to do regex. and i try to avoid it as much as possible, but in automation its sometimes necessary."

zabbix network alerts,"hey, this month we had multiple time a case that the internet line was 100 usage, and some times it was random workstationservers and after looking at the palo acc i was able to find the workstationservers and restart them or what other thing i had to do to fix the network usage. i was wondering that if there is a way via api or panos to send a mailalert to me when the acc see that in the last 15 minutes a top source has reached more then 70gb have anyone done it ? thanks in advance || i monitor my throughput of my interfaces on firewalls with my nms. would something like that work?"
zabbix network alerts,"hi everyone, im not too knowledgeable about networking in general, or the cisco meraki system, but ive been tasked with fixing this as the only member of my companys it department that actually comes into the office. so apologies if i describe this incorrectly. weve been receiving ip address conflict alerts for devices that are receiving their ips via dhcp, each alert identifies two mac addresses that are claiming the same ip. i did some digging in the meraki console today and noticed that its actually the same device thats claiming the ip, but from two different mac addresses. for reference, each of these devices are apple laptops. the first mac address is for the devices primary wifi adapter, which i can locate easily using any of our management systems in this case i can find it using jamf, but im not sure where the second mac is coming from. its not the devices ethernet adapter mac. my team and i suspect its related to the feature thats enabled on all of the apple laptops in our fleet. has anyone seen this before? || you said you are not sure where the second mac address is coming from. this makes me question your assertion that both mac addresses are from the same device. || block the 2nd mac address on your dhcp server and see what happens. || apple devices have a mac randomization features, maybe this could be what youre observing? || check the manufacturer section of the mac address is part of the block used for private mac addresses. also see what switch port or ap the second mac shows up on. does it show on the same ap, or a different switch port. if the 2nd mac is on its own port, where does that port go, does it go back to the same user? || is the 2nd mac also an apple one? and these are both wifi connects, yeah? i also agree with blocking that one and see who starts screaming. im curious how this pans out as its similar to my issue where i have a camera system nvr that will have its camera switch facing interface steal the ip of the router facing interface and start communicating out that interface causing the duplicate detection. || are they running a hyper visor and hosting virtual machines? || if one of the macs second digit starts with 2, 6, a or e, its a locallyadministered random mac. im working a case right now where some video equipment is arping to some switches using both their hardware and a virtual mac. || it sounds like private mac addressing that apple does. there is an option to turn it off on the devices wifi settings."
zabbix network alerts,"i am looking to upgrade hardware for metroregional wan network hub sites, and want to provide hardware redundancy. this wan serves a geodiverse dual core 911 call handling system, where each of 2 hub sites has single links dark fiberlayer2 leased link or lte modem tunneled to the psap remote sites. the hardware i inherited consists of single layer3 switches c9200cx at each hub site, with eigrp handling routing, and hsrp providing gateway redundancy between the 2 hub sites. the racks also contain a cold spare, older model, not up to date config. i have purchased 2 stacks of 2 c9300 switches to replace them, and i want to have 1 of each stack as active and one as standby, with identical interface configurations on each. since i am limited to having 1 remote site wan link for each hub site 1 dark fiber or cradle point serving each remote i would have to manually move cablessfps from one switch to the next in event of hardware failure, but i want to make sure that the standby router is configured and ready to rock should that be necessary, and i want to make sure that any config tweaks on the active are automatically propagated to the standby. since only one of each pair will be connected to the wan links, i dont really need millisecond failover from sso, or continuous forwarding from nsf or graceful restart routing stability, since any hardware failure would require physical intervention for link migration, and i want eigrp to route around the failure. i just want the peace of mind that should something happen, ive got a fully configured and booted spare right there in the rack below the failed device, and all that is required for bringing it online is a 1 for 1 move of each wan link. and a bonus question since this is an airgapped network, how would you handle alerting for failure states? || id have more piece of mind with an easy to use backup system and then some spares of the exact model in use, so i can just copy it over and roll. || you have dark fiber, like a pair of strands? swap to bidi optics and you turn those two strands into two links. doesnt protect against a fiber cut, but you can get hardware redundancy at each site which helps quite a bit."
zabbix network alerts,"hi fellow network people, i am going to be evaluating some monitoring tools. goals is to find a tool which will suit monitoring about 30ish locations, with a mix of network vendors. budget is a bit of an issue.. the organisation is a non profit organisation heavily relying on government and local funding. edit this doesnt mean it needs to be a free tool, but it needs to be affordable and usable without to many customization work or expert knowledge prtg and zabbix seem to be for the two id like to get started with, also open to other alternatives in that class random question does anyone have any insights about how expensive solarwinds is? looking forward to hearing your experiences || the same company who bought prtg and increased their pricing just bought solarwinds, so i honestly would not look to either solution if cost management is a big concern. there are plenty of purely free open source tools in the network space that are perfectly capably with lots of history and existing documentation like zabbix or librenms. at that scale i probably wouldnt implement something like prometheus because its just a bit more of a chore to manage and a non profit with 30 locations probably isnt big enough to leverage the benefits of those kind of technologies and would have a hard time affording the kind of staff who are already familiar with them. || anything but solar winds. prtg if you want to spend money on licensing. zabbix if you want to spend money on labor hours. || zabbix is great once you get over the learning curve. ptrg is more user friendly at the beginning. zabbix can do more once you understand how to setup the triggers. you can also do live network maps like cacti, which ptrg is weirdly missing. i got rid of our prtg setup for zabbix. || for starters, prtg isnt free, so zabbix has the upper hand here. random question does anyone have any insights about how expensive solarwinds is? the current price doesnt matter. solarwinds was recently sold to a private equity firm, so prices will most likely increase. || there was a really great packet pushers episode that came out days ago where exactly this was discussed. hn767 effective networking on the cheap. id recommend giving that a listen, i think the guest had a very well informed view, and made some points that i think would apply well to your scenario. || librenms is a good alternative to prtg and zabbix. it works great for monitoring and configuration backups for large organizations. || zabbix no question asked || as others have said, rule out prtg and solarwinds. the fact that a foreign actor was able to slip code into solarwinds orion should have honestly been the nail in the coffin, but here we still are... i would say it depends on your infrastructure. if you dont have any cloud consoles, then librenms is just dandy for snmp monitoring and simple config backups with oxidized. if you have cloud consoles meraki, aruba instant on, or the like, then things get a little dicier. || ive been using prtg for the past five years, but its simply a different company now. pricing went up, and quality slipping is next. it pains me to say it as a longterm customer, but look elsewhere. theyve sold out. || libre is a go to for many who just want it to work. zabbix can do anything if you can make it ..but will do a lot builtin and is a real nms. people will glue graphical frotnends like graphana on zabbix to make more pretty. we use zabbix as a place that only had cacti before and its great. i have reviewed the mentioned others and we used solarwinds as well || librenms is the best solution if you dont want to do too much customization .zabbix does everything but requires more work. prtg is ok but its a paid subscription and last time i checked the server is windows only. || started using zabbix in a non profit several years ago, using it right now in a big enterprise with more than 60 sites globally and more than 10 data centers. we bought a company two years ago, they were on ptrg, obviously now on zabbix. honestly i wouldnt think a minute over this, its free, well documented, enterprise ready, huge community behind it.. || are you looking strictly for self hosted? which features are most important to you for each device? if saas is an option, then could be a great fit! just revamped our pricing which starts from 1.50 per device with unlimited metrics. you pick and choose what you want to monitor across your sites. we still give details of other devices included. zabbix is also really great if looking for a free option and opened source. if any questions, dont hesitate. || my advice, prometheus and grafana for monitoring your environments. || librenms for us."
