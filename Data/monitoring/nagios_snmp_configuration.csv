nagios snmp configuration,"i, as im sure many, have been really struggling with the halfassed or generally poor support from vendors when using protocols like yang. im not here to poo poo on either or debate why cli scraping is better or worse than yang. however, i am interested in what other people in the industry are doing with regard to workflows for figuring out how to program against a new devices netconfyang interface. my current workflow, to get started and probably optimize, is loading the device and its yang models into ill gather the current device config via netconf from this tool and store it in a file. ill then go into the cli of the device and make the changes im testing. via yangsuite, ill pull the config again, store in a new text file and then diff the two. hopefully, this gives me the namespaces and xpath values that i need to use to dig into the specific yang models. this is clearly not very efficient and im wondering if theres a better way to do this. ultimately, im aiming to make jinja templates to handle routine system level things, banners, logging, snmp, etc, and then more specific things like service creationmodificationremoval that might do things like modify interface configurations, configure layer 2 or 3 items. like i said, im sure theres more than one way to do it and im curious how we can collectively make this process better for everyone. || this is probably the hardest part of the whole workflow if you need to mock up the structure of a complex block of config then indeed thats probably the best way to do it for now. once you have an overall structure in place and you need to add or remove a feature or two its usually pretty easy to track it down on its own in the model and then add the required field. ill give you an example from my workflow. i have a routine that generates interface configs from netbox, and i recently needed to disable proxy arp on a subset of interfaces. since we use openconfig for our interface definitions i looked at and tried to find anything related to proxy arp, and ended up finding openconfiginterfacesinterfaceroutedvlanproxyarpconfigmode, which allows me to set what i needed to set, so it was just a matter of adding that leaf to the config generation module. sometimes, when dealing with native models, i will just open the yang file for the model in a text editor and search for strings that i would consider to be likely names of fields based on functionality i.e. if you want to set nexthopself on a bgp peer, search for nexthop, and in iosxrs native bgp models youll find a leaf called nexthopself under a neighbors address family, and from there you can often discern the structure as well. you could in theory reverse engineer a whole block of config using that approach, but i oftentimes cheat and instead configure it on the device and then do a gnmi get to see what it looks like modeled. once you do this dozens or hundreds of times you start to get a good intuition on where to find things. || besides yangsuite, i found that getting the path with gnmic is useful i like is clibased and even if i get too much output, i can grep it. there is also a tool called that can help you get paths. and since you commented you are also using nso, one way to get the xpath is to configure something i dont remember if you have to commit or not and then do a dryrun dispaly xpath if you have to commit the config, then you do a show devices devices config ... display xpath in nso there more options useful when using the display option. in nso you can also evaluate xpaths for example adminncsconfig xpath eval devicesdeviceaddress devicesdeviceaddress 127.0.0.1 devicesdeviceaddress 127.0.0.1 devicesdeviceaddress 127.0.0.1 adminncsconfig xpath eval devicesdeviceaddress devicesdeviceaddress 127.0.0.1 a bit of disclaimer, i work for cisco and i dont maintain a network but found these resources useful."
nagios snmp configuration,"hi all, our customer has a series of network equipment and hosts that require monitoring via snmp. they are all configured to use snmp v2c dont think they support snmp v3 and i am looking for software to install on a windows pc to monitor this equipment, there are about 50x endpoints in total including the network equipment i dont mind if the software is free or a one off perpetual cost, however due to funding i dont want a subscription based software where you pay an annual cost can anyone recommend something to try please? || start with not windows then work out what exactly you want and what you want to do with it. libranms, icinga, zabbix, graphs grafana, cacti syslogng, greylog there are open source setups for just about everything. spin up a vm and go foe your life. || look into librenms || solarwinds kiwi syslog also does snmp traps || do you need traps or just snmp polling? do you need to use windows? there are many free options for linux. || icinga is free || ive used cacti but only ever deployed it on debian. caveat, the windows version may or may not be current. || run snmp in a wsl instance."
nagios snmp configuration,"id like to move off solarwinds, but some of the things weve setup on there seem like theyd be difficult to replicate. im curious if anyone knows of monitoring products that may be able to replicate these. this includes 1 custom alert triggers with device variables ie. send an email to devices snmpcontact with device hostname included in the email and use regex to add readable log to body. 2 pictures i integrated device photos into the location and node pages. we have pictures of every rack and network device wed like to utilize. 3 configuration device backups and device changes. we push out changes and generate new device configs with ncm templates. 4 endpoint search able to search mac and port descriptions to find connected endpoints. || librenms netboxnautobot oxidized. also a linux box and something like a gitlab server to store your code in. || do you want them all in a single application? if youre ok with more than one app, for 3 theres rancid, unimus, rconfig and another that the name escapes me. for 4 netdisco is awesome. i use it all the time. makes finding where a device is connected from an ip or mac really easy. || single application for this will be hard. if you want to go with 2, will do 1,2,4 and for 3. both also crossintegrate really nicely. you can sync your inventory from netxms into unimus, so you dont need to manage it in 2 places. add a device to netxms, unimus will sync it and start managing its config, generating diffs and change notifications, etc. automatically. you can also have monitoring for unimus in netxms. for failed backups, last change overview, or even trigger config pushes in unimus from netxms. its a really nice stack for nms and ncm. || zabbix can monitor devices and send alerts. netdisco for searching devices. || ive moved around quite a bit, and the stack ive been happiest with is netbox but only for the rackspace bit. librenms dont really like it, but have found nothing better unimus i love this product for other features you didnt mention that i generally consider part of the network management stack, i still havent found one i love for ipam so ill just use netbox for that, but honestly dont love it. for logging i got so frustrated with the landscape that i ended up building my own solution. || lol did you know about the private equity buyout before posting this? || great timing || can replicate most of this for you. i wanted to ask my colleague who has worked at solarwinds, auvik and now domotz as a product manager but she is on holidays atm. 1 many custom alert triggers, variables and scripting options virtually infinite possibilities 2 we do have network topology mapping which you can export for use in visio. im inquiring about the use of pictures internally, you can add custom notes but i dont believe directly in the software. ill brb with the official answer on pictures! 3 we have remote config management features including remote device configmanagementbackup security alerts and changelog. 4 very powerful searchoranization functionalities. totally free, no cc. and then pricing options from 1.50device. happy to help here or on rdomotz if you have any questions. || just stay away from logicmonitor. it sucks. its obvious lm havent put any money into development in a very long time. the product has remained stagnant and the support sucks. lm promised all these additional features and they simply havent delivered. || solarwinds getting sold to private equity nows probably the time start moving away. || i moved off solar water nds back when they had their supply chain hack. ended up setting up librenms and oxidized as a temp solution. still using 5 years later. added elastiflow for netflow monitoring. only thing you are looking for that i dont have is the endpoint search. netdisco should cover that. i do custom templates for my alerts. i dont know how to do the linked photo thing but i have ideas ona way to do it. || what network hardware are you using? || observium is another option to look into as well || 2 pictures i integrated device photos into the location and node pages. we have pictures of every rack and network device wed like to utilize. how did you do this? || been using nectus for over a year and love it."
nagios snmp configuration,"hello, i just settled up a sinec nms configuration. i configurated the snmp traps by desactivating windows trap service and replace them by the operation trap service of sinec nms. while this has been done, i restarted my operation as explained in the sinec documentation. when my operation restarted, i went to operation network administration device credential repository and settled up the snmp configuration of my management station the sinec nms client in the snmp monitoring tab, to receive snmpv3 traps on the port 162. i just wonder how does this work ? does this configuration mean that we configure sinec to autoask his port 162 with snmpv3 requests to accept snmpv3 traps ? and if thats the case, can we configure more snmpv3 configurations to get multiple snmpv3 traps through the same port with differents snmpv3 traps profiles ? best regards || "

through problems. i see your skills list and immediately think of questions to ask to determine if its surface level knowledge or you really understand it like can you tell me about your migration
