blackbox_exporter,Introduction,"Visitinghttp://localhost:9115/probe?target=google.com&module=http_2xxwill return metrics for a HTTP probe against google.com. Theprobe_successmetric indicates if the probe succeeded. Adding adebug=trueparameter
will return debug information for that probe."
blackbox_exporter,Introduction,"Metrics concerning the operation of the exporter itself are available at the
endpointhttp://localhost:9115/metrics."
blackbox_exporter,Introduction,"To use TLS and/or basic authentication, you need to pass a configuration file
using the--web.config.fileparameter. The format of the file is describedin the exporter-toolkit repository."
blackbox_exporter,Introduction,"Note that the TLS and basic authentication settings affect all HTTP endpoints:
/metrics for scraping, /probe for probing, and the web UI."
blackbox_exporter,Introduction,Configuration
blackbox_exporter,Introduction,"Blackbox exporter is configured via aconfiguration fileand command-line flags (such as what configuration file to load, what port to listen on, and the logging format and level)."
blackbox_exporter,Introduction,"Blackbox exporter can reload its configuration file at runtime. If the new configuration is not well-formed, the changes will not be applied.
A configuration reload is triggered by sending aSIGHUPto the Blackbox exporter process or by sending a HTTP POST request to the/-/reloadendpoint."
blackbox_exporter,Introduction,"To specify whichconfiguration fileto load, use the--config.fileflag."
blackbox_exporter,Introduction,"Additionally, anexample configurationis also available."
blackbox_exporter,Introduction,"HTTP, HTTPS (via thehttpprober), DNS, TCP socket, ICMP and gRPC (see permissions section) are currently supported.
Additional modules can be defined to meet your needs."
blackbox_exporter,Introduction,"The timeout of each probe is automatically determined from thescrape_timeoutin thePrometheus config, slightly reduced to allow for network delays.
This can be further limited by thetimeoutin the Blackbox exporter config file. If neither is specified, it defaults to 120 seconds."
blackbox_exporter,Introduction,Prometheus Configuration
blackbox_exporter,Introduction,"Blackbox exporter implements the multi-target exporter pattern, so we advice
to read the guideUnderstanding and using the multi-target exporter patternto get the general
idea about the configuration."
blackbox_exporter,Introduction,Example config:
blackbox_exporter,Introduction,"scrape_configs:
  -job_name:'blackbox'metrics_path:/probeparams:module:[http_2xx]#Look for a HTTP 200 response.static_configs:
      -targets:
        -http://prometheus.io#Target to probe with http.-https://prometheus.io#Target to probe with https.-http://example.com:8080#Target to probe with http on port 8080.relabel_configs:
      -source_labels:[__address__]target_label:__param_target-source_labels:[__param_target]target_label:instance-target_label:__address__replacement:127.0.0.1:9115#The blackbox exporter's real hostname:port.-job_name:'blackbox_exporter'#collect blackbox exporter's operational metrics.static_configs:
      -targets:['127.0.0.1:9115']"
blackbox_exporter,Introduction,HTTP probes can accept an additionalhostnameparameter that will setHostheader and TLS SNI. This can be especially useful withdns_sd_config:
blackbox_exporter,Introduction,"scrape_configs:
  -job_name:blackbox_allmetrics_path:/probeparams:module:[ http_2xx ]#Look for a HTTP 200 response.dns_sd_configs:
      -names:
          -example.com-prometheus.iotype:Aport:443relabel_configs:
      -source_labels:[__address__]target_label:__param_targetreplacement:https://$1/#Make probe URL be like https://1.2.3.4:443/-source_labels:[__param_target]target_label:instance-target_label:__address__replacement:127.0.0.1:9115#The blackbox exporter's real hostname:port.-source_labels:[__meta_dns_name]target_label:__param_hostname#Make domain name become 'Host' header for probe requests-source_labels:[__meta_dns_name]target_label:vhost#and store it in 'vhost' label"
